(1, 'Taylor Parks\r\n', '\"Not Doing Things Is Soul Destroying\" - Kevin Shields Of MBV Interviewed\r\n', 'Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine pulls up a chair with Taylor Parks and gives one of his lengthiest and most revealing interviews to date\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">I</span>t\'s hard to describe what it sounded like back then, you know. They were different times. It\'s not that there\'s no innovation now – of course there is, though it mostly comes from elsewhere – but for a short time in the late 1980s it seemed that every year a handful of rock records could shake you up, arrive with something new... and not just new-to-you, but something fresh and bloody, still quivering, something you weren\'t prepared for. This was the last clearly-audible gasp for guitar music with tunes, of course: Simon Reynolds\' declaration that all those blindingly imaginative albums from \'87 and \'88 were in fact \"rock going supernova\" proved more accurate than anyone hoped. But those were the times – the end of the beginning.</p>\r\n<p>This was something else, though. Really. My Bloody Valentine – a largely-ignored, little-league group from the dying days of the \"cutie\" cult, who\'d trundled along for a couple of years singing songs called \'Sunny Sundae Smile\', nursery rhymes with deceptively demonic lyrics which no one listened to anyway – turned up on Creation Records with a single called \'You Made Me Realise\'. Everyone shrugged, gave it a spin, and... Christ al-fucking-mighty. Christ al-fucking-mighty.</p>\r\n<p>And the funny thing is, we\'d heard nothing yet. The galloping heart, the unbearable urgency, even that bit in the middle where it just kind of froze, tipped a gallon of petrol over itself, grinned and flicked the lighter... it turned out we\'d heard nothing yet. \'You Made Me Realise\' may still be the greatest pop record My Bloody Valentine ever made, but once the album Isn\'t Anything arrived at the end of \'88, it was clear that there was something more: this was not a chance encounter between some indie also-rans and a barrage of horrible, marvellous noise. This was the work of the most outrageously original British/Irish band in years, an album which – at least at its best – seemed born from nothing, an unthinkable joy. People went crazy. Really. What could possibly follow that?</p>\r\n<p>The answer – after what was considered an unreasonably lengthy wait, ha ha – was Loveless, one of the most celebrated albums of what we might call \"our time\". Opinions were split back then, as now, over whether Loveless really went as far and as deep as we might have expected, but in that yawning gap between the album\'s release and the band\'s reformation, this ceased to matter: what remained was a record capable of taking the faces off new generations, a message drifting in from what sounded like rock music\'s afterlife: no more shouting, no more posing, only pure untrammelled feeling. And in there, arguably the absolute high point of the post-punk era, \'To Here Knows When\' – a track which brings me as close to tears as any music ever does, not because it \"says\" or \"communicates\" anything, but because it doesn\'t have to. What could possibly follow that?</p>\r\n<p>Of course, until now, the answer has been \"well... nothing.\" The long-lost sequel to Loveless has become a 20-year running joke. Almost everyone Kevin has met in the last half-decade or so (and indeed, the half-decade between Loveless itself and the band\'s original disintegration) was told the same thing: it\'ll probably be out \"in a few months\", \"later this year\", \"soon\". And still we wait... and still we wait. This time, though, there seems to be a new urgency and excitement to his claims, and if (as he says) they\'ve completed eight tracks already, then holding one\'s breath – while still inadvisable – may at least, at last, be permitted.</p>\r\n<p>In the here and now, anyway, are newly-issued remasters of Isn\'t Anything and Loveless - four years, almost to the day, since they were first released to the press and reviewed dutifully by The Quietus. There\'s also a compilation out: the band\'s four essential EPs remastered, complete with seven rare or previously unreleased songs. Reason enough to head for a crowded tapas bar in Camden Town, and spend the evening listening to My Bloody Valentine\'s elusive auteur discuss the noise... and the absence of noise.</p>\r\n<p>The cloud of shaggy hair\'s gone grey, and he\'s wearing some professorial specs, but Kevin Shields hasn\'t changed much. Rather quiet and unassuming until you settle down to talk, at which point he\'s unstoppable: no one\'s idea of a ranter, but happy to speak at length about his work, his past, his present, his flaws, his strengths, his bugbears, his disappointments... when the tape goes off we manage another half-hour on two shared interests - the history of British recording studios and the horrors of dentistry – just for the hell of it. For someone so maddeningly prone to silence, the bloke can certainly talk.</p>\r\n<p>And so: the full record of a two hour conversation with arguably the single most innovative musician from rock\'s last two and a half decades... even though, for most of that time, he\'s been unaccountably absent. Not any more, it seems. The absence is over, and here\'s the account. The man who wasn\'t there is back.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">It\'s been four years since the remasters of Isn\'t Anything and Loveless first emerged. Have you done any more tinkering in that time?</span></p>\r\n<p>Kevin Shields: Just a few bits and pieces. Well, basically what happened is the mastering place kind of lost them. So I had to put them back together again, and when I was putting them back together again I did them a bit better. But no radical changes that anyone would notice.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">One interesting thing about the EPs is that they trace the development of the My Bloody Valentine sound. There\'s a very distinct progression from one to the next. To what extent was that an artistic development, and to what extent a technical one?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well it was both, I suppose. One of the most important things to begin with, around the time of \'You Made Me Realise\', was that my friend Bill Carey - who used to be in a band called Crash with Kurt Ralske from Ultra Vivid Scene - he said \'you\'ve got to borrow my gear\', and one of the things he lent us was the Jazzmaster guitar. With the tremolo arm on it. And back in 1984 when I was in Berlin and really into The Cramps, I\'d had the idea, imagine if you just constantly used the tremolo arm when you played guitar? So I thought \"I must try this...\"</p>\r\n<p>So I\'d been playing the song \'Slow\', and previously I\'d been using this reverse reverb which I\'d read about in a Bob Mould interview - I used it all over the Strawberry Wine EP, but I used it the same way loads of people have used that stuff. In rehearsal I\'d been playing really fast, like something off the [Birthday Party\'s] Mutiny EP or the Bad Seed EP, that kind of thing: a very fast strum with a slow beat on the drums. But I tried it with the tremolo arm and it was amazing, I\'d never come across anything like that. I mean, I\'d tried Bigsbys (standard tremolo arms) and they didn\'t agree with me at all, the guitar would go out of tune and stuff...</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">There\'s something unusual about the tremolo arm on the Jazzmaster?</p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah. The spring is similar to a Bigsby, but they go all the way round. A Bigsby only goes round to there, but on the Jazzmaster you can pull it right over, and hold onto it the whole time you\'re playing. So I modified it, I moved it round and put tape on it so it wouldn\'t go all the way in, changed the bridge so it was super loose, more part of your hand than part of the guitar. So if you let go it would practically fall off.</p>\r\n<p>Actually, when I first tried it I thought \"that\'s OK\", but it wasn\'t really working. It was like an old rock and roll thing, like [Cramps guitarist] Poison Ivy, that sort of woooaaaaawwww noise. But I was really into hip-hop as well, and what I liked about that was that it used so many samples that were half-buried or muted, a real sense of sounds being semi-decayed, or destroyed, but then re-used. So I turned the tone on the guitar right down to see what happened... and suddenly it sounded great. Suddenly I had this... melted sound.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">So the new sound began here...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well... by that time, live we\'d become that kind of band anyway, we just hadn\'t recorded it. Live we\'d always been much harder than the records ever were. The records were like playing games. They were conceptual, all the early ones, they had kind of sick lyrics and... it just felt like we were messing about. Then when Bilinda joined, around that 86-87 period, we were getting into Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr, Sister and EVOL by Sonic Youth... they put a different slant on everything for me. A slightly more melodic, more soulful, more beautiful element. And when Bilinda joined it all became more balanced. So we were happy with the You Made Me Realise EP because suddenly we had something we could play live. The difference between the record and what we were live was much less. And it was actually easier to play that most of the stuff from the Ecstasy record.</p>\r\n<p>So for the You Made Me Realise EP we got five days in the studio. Which we were very grateful for, because before that we\'d been given seven days to make a mini-album, that Ecstasy thing. But because of how we lived at the time - we were in squats and had a very transient, free life – we didn\'t rehearse too much. Even back then we\'d write in the studio, just go in with the basic bare bones of stuff. But then we got two months to make Isn\'t Anything, in a residential studio in Wales. And the guy we were recording with was a good guy, Dave Anderson – he\'d been in loads of interesting bands like Hawkwind and Amon Duul II, as a teenager he\'d been over to Germany – so he gave us a crash course in Krautrock. We\'d been listening to loads of it, but he told us all the stories about taking acid all the time, getting into all sorts of trouble... so lines were crossing in the right way, you know? And when we were making the You Made Me Realise EP I\'d become consumed by a certain attitude... but to be honest it came out more on Isn\'t Anything than the Feed Me With Your Kiss EP, which was more the darker side.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">The darker side?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: I mean, the band always sits between positive and negative, I guess, and that was veering towards the negative. A darker sound. People listen to the Feed Me With Your Kiss EP and say it\'s a bit more lo-fi than the one before, because I was becoming more conscious of high frequencies and - partly from the hip-hop thing - I was thinking \"You don\'t have to keep putting all this top end on everything, making it all separate and bright.\" The \'80s production value, basically. So the sound of that record is part of that whole attitude, which was solidifying around that time, but it\'s all low frequencies, not much top end.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Were you discovering a lot of new stuff as you went along in the studio?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yes and no. There was less technology involved than people imagine – most of the sound was just the guitar with the tremolo arm - but it was there to an extent. The You Made Me Realise EP was the first time we used sampling, the middle bit where it goes chhhhhhhhh – at that time there were these things called Bel delay units, and you could basically use them as samplers. You could put something into the delay and then play it, as a part. It\'s all over Isn\'t Anything. You could do things like put a little sound into it, and there was an arrow going up and an arrow going down, and we were sat there going \"up up up up up...\" There were no pitch wheels or anything, just up and down buttons which we sat there pressing frantically.</p>\r\n<p>Then on Glider, that\'s a part of guitar and bass with a drum loop, then the rest of the sound you hear is all guitar feedback, sampled. Just hours of sampling feedback and editing it on the sampler, without a keyboard or anything... and on \'Soon\' the vocals that go \"ahhh\" are sampled too. There\'s a song called \'Off Your Face\', where the acoustic guitar is put through a flanger set to zero, so it\'s not really doing anything, it just makes it sort of digitised and damaged...</p>\r\n<p>Then we got our first proper sampler, an old Akai, which were quite common by \'89 because dance music had exploded. The Tremolo EP was where we really got lost in sampling. That\'s got loads of sampled feedback played on a keyboard, stuff from round that time... there\'s a song called \'Swallow\', which has a belly dancing tape from Berlin, Turkish music, a sample just taken off the cassette. But I think we used technology much less than people imagine. Like I said, I was just fascinated by the sounds of things taken from the living world and made immortal, but kind of damaged or mummified in the process.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I remember having a bootleg of a David Bowie show as a kid - the last Spiders From Mars show. A really distorted audience tape, and it sounded incredibly powerful and unearthly. Then a friend of mine got the official album, which was recorded and mixed properly, and it was a terrible let-down.</span><p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, this is it. Starting from \'You Made Me Realise\', when we were mixing, I wanted something that sounded like it was going through one of those little BOSE PA systems, a big mush. That 80s production value - even on the records I liked, the Sonic Youth and Dinosaur records - even though they merged the bass and guitar, the vocals were so loud and the drums were so loud, it was just kind of rocky to me. It was hip hop that really shook me up – not dance music, because people forget that dance music back then was kind of shit. Just crappy house music. It was for having an amazing experience in a club on ecstasy, but there was nothing sonically interesting about it. I mean, I\'d been into electronic music since I got into music. I got a synth in \'81, and I gave up the guitar after about a year of playing it. I thought, \"Ah, this is pointless, I\'m never going to do anything different. It\'s all been done.\"</p>\r\n<p>But that\'s when I really got into all the bending stuff - we were into DAF and they had a live drummer, but they were playing to a tape with a synthesizer drifting in and out of tune... really unsettling. When Jimi Hendrix did \'Wild Thing\' at Monterey, if you listen to it there\'s a bit at the end where the tape goes all wrong, and it was one of my favourite live musical things, that footage... and the Sex Pistols, at the end of one of their songs it bends, the tape goes wrong. But that really stuck in my mind. Because tapes, cassettes, were such a big part of music when I was young, and whenever you\'d hear music slow down and bend, it was like \"oh shit\" and you\'d have to stop it and fish the tape out of the machine... But I had a fascination with the bending pitch phenomenon. So when I got that guitar which my friend lent me, which could do something other guitars couldn\'t, it was like discovering distortion for the first time or something, or echo: \"Oh my God this is amazing, I can express myself at last...\"</p>\r\n<p>It\'s not just bending a guitar out of tune, it has more in common with... what\'s that thing where an ambulance goes by?</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">The Doppler effect.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah. It\'s pitch and volume... energy and pitch are related. What I do is hard to replicate if you just use a guitar pedal which goes up and down in pitch because it doesn\'t have the dynamic quality. It\'s not just bending the guitar in and out of tune, it became an expressive thing. Even to this day, the only way I can play like that is if I go still – that\'s why I\'m relatively still on stage – because you can\'t play like that if you\'re jumping around the place. You have to be... not in a meditative state, but something close to that. Your subconscious takes over, and it just comes out like that. It feels... not like magic, but it\'s like talking or walking, you just do it. If you try to be conscious of it you become bad at it. That\'s the weird part, it became an expressive tool. And to work properly it has to be not just me playing the guitar but me becoming part of the sound.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">That makes sense in terms of the themes of the songs as well as the sound – the sense of being disembodied, the loss-of-self. So many of those songs are about sex, but there\'s nothing carnal or thrusting about them. It\'s as far removed from Led Zeppelin as you can get.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, because their sex songs were about wanting it. We were doing it! It\'s from the inside out, rather than the outside in.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">That applies to a lot of things to do with My Bloody Valentine, doesn\'t it? For instance, people often talk about your music in terms of drugs, but maybe that shows a failure of imagination. There aren\'t many drug songs, and it doesn\'t really sound like music to be listened to on drugs. It sounds drugged, more than druggy.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, well it definitely wasn\'t about drugs. Pot, maybe. But very few of the songs were even written when I was stoned. And we certainly never played or mixed or recorded stoned. Mainly because we were too tired. The You Made Me Realise EP and the Feed Me With Your Kiss EP, that was when we got really into sleep deprivation. We were into that all the way up to about 1990, when we got tired of it, literally. Me and Colm used to see who could stay up the longest - a lot of the music was done after being awake for 24 hours, and certainly the majority of those EPs were done on a couple of hours\' sleep. We never had more than a couple of hours. Which created a kind of slightly manic, overtired condition, which when you\'re younger is a boost. For a few months, it\'s good. But then you burn out.</p>\r\n<p>That was the thing though – it\'s not that altered states of mind weren\'t involved, they were, big time. I had some pretty weird experiences. But that\'s what it was, sleep deprivation. That\'s what happens when you don\'t sleep much. It brings the subconscious into the present world.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">You can definitely hear that. There\'s a lot of feeling there, but not very much \"emotion\", at least in rock & roll terms – those records don\'t sound impassioned or declamatory, they\'re very blurry, but they\'re full of sensation.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: That\'s why the EPs have a different feel to the Loveless record, to me a completely different feel. We started sleeping again, and the sound changed. \'Soon\' and \'To Here Knows When\' are different versions on the EPs and the albums, different mixes. I finished the Tremolo EP early in 1991, and in a way that was the end of my journey with tonality. Loveless was brighter – not going so much in that direction of everything being blunted. And that\'s why those versions of those songs are different, remixed. They had to be, to fit into the album.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I was listening to the EP version on the way here, and it did sound different after all those years of listening mostly to the LP version. Less information.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, that\'s right. There\'s only one guitar on the EP version of \'Soon\', but on the album version there\'s another one overlaid. Actually, on the two versions of Loveless which exist, the original and the remaster, the \'Soon\'s are completely different. I had to remake it in 2007 – it\'s the original mix but there\'s this guitar layered on top, which I had to do again, and it\'s almost impossible to do. Much easier this time around because technology has improved, but it still took a few days because the guitar just didn\'t want to sit on top. If someone listens to them on headphones, you\'re going to notice a huge difference between the old version and the new, especially when it goes into the vocal part. So there are actually three versions of \'Soon\'. But it\'s all about that guitar track.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Most experimental rock is based around improvisation, but My Bloody Valentine have always been quite structured, really - the wildness is the sound, coming out of the instruments - so I see how one different guitar track can change the balance.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Every time we play a song it\'s going to be a little different just because of that. Which is why, contrary to popular belief, there aren\'t a lot of guitar tracks on those songs. Usually just one. They just sound big.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Because dubbing another over the top would fill in the gaps, flatten it out?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, one sounds big and two sounds smaller. They fight with each other. Although the song I\'m working on now, at the moment there\'s two, but I\'ve come to like it like that... and I\'m still trying to decide, should it be one or two?</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">It sounds like what you do in the studio has more in common with painting.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, maybe. Because of the time we came out, when CDs were new, it allowed me to go somewhere I couldn\'t have gone when it was just vinyl, in terms of sitting down and fine tuning. In a nutshell, with vinyl – which I love – there\'s an EQ curve on all record players, on the phono input. It takes the bass and treble up and the mid-range down. If you listen to a record without that, it sounds wrong, it\'s all middle. That\'s what a vinyl record really sounds like, it\'s just mid-range. And you get an exaggerated version of that curve on cheap systems to make them sound more hi-fi, and then there\'s people who have their own systems with crazy EQ set-ups and whatever.</p>\r\n<p>So when you\'re making a record, it\'s a hard thing... different cuts of the record sound different, the kind of vinyl has an effect. I mean, what the needle looks like is a snowplough, because there\'s always dust in the air and the grooves have all got shit in them, and the needle just throws all that out the way, ploughing through it. So depending on the vinyl and how heavy it is and how dirty it is, the needle can be dancing and jumping as it goes... so you get all those variations in the sound. But the CD pushed things more in the direction where people actually hear what you got on that digital master. Which encouraged me to go as far as I wanted in terms of fine balance, whereas if I\'d been around in the \'60s or \'70s that would just have been pointless.</p>\r\n<p>Like in the \'60s, there was a belief system that no one can hear a difference of 1.5 db. And that lasted until the \'80s, but now it\'s understood that people can hear a 4db difference. We all perceive music differently [now] to how people perceived music 30 years ago, because our brains have been trained. We listen in a different way, and digital\'s allowed that to happen. That\'s the positive side of it – obviously, it\'s also added a coldness and a hardness too, which is exaggerated by modern production techniques. But it\'s allowed me a lot of freedom.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">So, going back to the time when you were recording these EPs, you were in squats...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, up until halfway through Loveless.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Were you heavily involved in that 80s squat scene? Parties and so on?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Oh yeah, we had great parties. We were famous for it! In \'87 and \'88... I wasn\'t necessarily the main instigator, but there was a big group of people, everyone was young – I was the eldest at 23, 24 – and we\'d just have a party and a couple of hundred people would turn up. And that evolved into this thing where every weekend it would become a free house. And what\'s remarkable about that is, throughout all that time nothing ever got stolen. It was amazing. I\'ve got no bad memories.</p>\r\n<p>Even when we toured in those days, we\'d have an open door policy backstage – by the time we were touring Loveless we\'d have 48 cans of beer on the rider for whoever happened to walk in – and again, it was an experiment because people aren\'t used to that. And nothing was stolen! There was one incident where a girl accidentally picked up one of the roadies\' coats, and that was the only time. Amazing.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">A lot of things had started to go badly wrong by the end of the 1980s, but in retrospect there was still a lot of freedom, wasn\'t there?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, the corporate control of things hadn\'t fully taken hold.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">It seems like the last time that what would now be called \"indie rock\" was consciously and genuinely experimental...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: I used to know James Brown, the journalist, when he was a fanzine writer. I met him on a bus one day and he was a bit down. He\'d just joined the NME, and on his first day a man in a suit came in and told them that NME was now going to be made more mainstream. Because they were trying to separate NME and Melody Maker, they were going to force NME to write about more mainstream stuff, while Melody Maker was going to be allowed to get less mainstream. You remember all that Arsequake stuff?</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I certainly do.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yeah, by 1988 it was all about us and Loop and Spacemen 3 and AR Kane - Skinny Puppy on the cover - they had carte blanche. I think that gave a greater weight to the less mainstream music that was around at the time, made it seem bigger than it was. And in a way, because they didn\'t really know what they were doing, the Men In Suits allowed that to happen.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">You don\'t want to know what happened when the Men In Suits came down to Melody Maker in 1996...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well, they don\'t know what they\'re doing, ever. At least at that time they created something which we benefited from.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Then, as things got a little less wild, we got that wave of supposedly post-My Bloody Valentine groups. Most of whom seemed to take the surface of that sound and apply it to something a lot less imaginative, a lot safer.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: I think a lot of it was because people got into the idea of it, the female energy thing, the perceived effects-laden guitar – and it wasn\'t, ever, we used no more effects than any blues player. I liked a lot of those groups as pop groups, and as people, but I guess I was a little resentful and annoyed... Well, not resentful and annoyed, but I just thought, \'people aren\'t getting this\'. We were put in the same category as a lot of groups who in many ways I\'d see as the antithesis of what we were about. Their production values, their attitudes, everything they were doing. The only thing we had in common was a certain basic... in the same way Herman\'s Hermits had something in common with The Beatles... No, that sounds a bit harsh. But you know, the Hermits had the harmonies and guitars, but really they didn\'t have much in common. And superficially those groups seemed to be doing the same thing as us, even though they weren\'t. And of course, Herman\'s Hermits were selling out stadiums in America in 1966 when The Beatles weren\'t. [smiles ruefully]</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Do you feel that you\'ve influenced a lot of good stuff? Or is there a bit of a space there?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: No, I\'ve seen it in all kinds of music. All kinds. Heavy metal... less so folk music, but even there. Dance music, bands that you\'d consider mainstream rock groups, U2 and Coldplay. The first Queens Of The Stone Age record, I was like, shit... I can see part of our attitude there. That lack of macho-ness... I\'m not saying they were directly influenced by us, but if I was to look out and see what we were doing then reflected now, I see it everywhere. Some of the better appropriations of ideas that we had, they\'ve turned up in music that has nothing to do with our sound.</p>\r\n<p>I think we were definitely a bit ahead of our time though, in that we were synergising something that was going to happen anyway. It wasn\'t that these things were so influenced by us, just that that energy was being born anyway, and we were one of the first puppies out. I don\'t know if it came from us, but it came through us. But it was trying to get out anyway. Like a leak...</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">When you were recording, what exactly was the role of the other band members?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Colm was always a very important musical partner. He was with me on it, even though I was leading it. He was getting it very quickly. That\'s why it was a bit of a disaster when everything went horribly wrong for him at the beginning of Loveless, which led to him not being on much of that record. But he still stuck with me - he only disappeared for a few months... he was the one who\'d worry about how to use the computer and the sampler, which allowed me to be a bit more free-minded. And he could see what was good, quickly.</p>\r\n<p>But I was writing the music and playing all the instruments, so I guess Debbie and Bilinda, playing-wise, never really had a role. But they didn\'t mind. Because it allowed the music to develop in a much more free way. If you\'re in a band and everyone\'s competing to have their parts heard, things don\'t happen, so that was the good side of it – there didn\'t have to be bass, there didn\'t have to be guitar, there didn\'t even have to be vocals. Anything could happen. It wasn\'t done in an egotistical way – I wasn\'t thinking \"I have to do all this myself\". But it\'s quicker to do it as you write it. If you have to write it and say \"here, learn this\" and then get a sound, it\'s too slow, it\'s not spontaneous. But it\'s quite common in the studio, a lot of bands, you\'d be really surprised – a lot of people in bands don\'t play on their records.</p>\r\n<p>And then it becomes its own thing when you play live. In our case it becomes a bit tougher, because Debbie\'s tougher in her style than I am, and Bilinda brings in a kind of garage rock quality, in a really good way. People very rarely hear our records and go \"oh, the live version is so much worse.\" It\'s all balanced.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">The sheer volume compensates for a lot of what\'s missing from the records.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well it\'s mostly all still there, but the balance isn\'t quite right because I can\'t control it onstage. That\'s what the volume makes up for – it fills the room to such an extent that any inconsistencies with the mixing are overshadowed by the fact that the whole room is saturated. So people\'s imaginations are dragged into the equation. We have to get that exactly right though, because it goes \"Wrong, wrong, too quiet, too loud – oh, there it is.\" And bang. When the balance of things is right, a little window opens into your mind. But I kind of like that all the live recordings of us on the internet are totally distorted. It means people have to use their imaginations...</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">You can\'t get a feeling for 130db from an mp3...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well, it\'s not usually that loud. Part of it comes from how you measure decibels, actually. There\'s A-weighting and C-weighting: C is the whole frequency range, but for human measurement, and for legal measuring, it\'s A-weighting. So if you flip the button between them, it rises. If you\'re on 110 or 120, and you flip the button to C-weighting, it becomes 130 – so that\'s where that myth comes from. We weren\'t quite that loud.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Even on the \"holocaust\" section of \'You Made Me Realise\'?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well I don\'t know, because sometimes the sound man likes to experiment. But I mean, the idea was never to rip people\'s heads off, or damage their hearing – that\'s why we gave everyone earplugs. I\'m not going to put people in the situation where they can\'t protect themselves. It was funny buying all those earplugs though - we once bought 50,000 for one gig, for Coachella. We were going to buy 70,000 but they said \"don\'t worry, because 20,000 won\'t take them no matter what.\" There\'s sort of a 25% element who are too cool or too uptight to take anything. \"No, I\'m fine, man.\"</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Or else they want the full experience, tinnitus and all.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well, my God... I don\'t want to give anyone tinnitus.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">So you were saying, Colm doesn\'t play on much of Loveless...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Colm cracked up because he was homeless - they got thrown out of the squat they were in, it was October, getting cold, he was sleeping on couches, and then he got a really bad virus. His health was getting worse and worse, and in the end he just cracked up. It was a really horrible period for all of us, too much pressure. Creation had zero money – around that time Felt wanted £2,000 to make their last album and Creation didn\'t have it, so they went somewhere else to do it – and they couldn\'t pay our studio bills, so we had our tapes confiscated. That happened a lot... One night we were in some studio in Ladbroke Grove and we had to sneak them out in the middle of the night. The only thing I had going for me round that time was that I knew we were making a good record.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">To what extent did the sound change as a result of Colm not playing?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: The drums became more functional. But the feel was still really important - what we didn\'t do was put them in a computer and quantise it. We went to huge lengths to make it not sound like a computer, we used loads of different samples for the cymbals and bass drums and snares, every tom hit is a different tom hit, we put movement into it...</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">But it doesn\'t sound like Colm, because he has this very distinctive style of drumming.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: He does, but what\'s weird is that the songs where he does play, like \'Only Shallow\', they don\'t stick out that much. But me and Colm learned together, we learned how to play together, so it was very strange when he couldn\'t do anything. All the songs had been worked out while he was getting sick, and then when he got really sick he couldn\'t use his legs. So we had the idea to program the bass drums and let him play snares and cymbals on top. And we did it all like that, but then when I tried to overdub, it wasn\'t good. I didn\'t know whether I was playing to the computer or the live person, it just wasn\'t working.</p>\r\n<p>So we took all that live playing he\'d done and sampled it. He was already playing those patterns, but we recreated it. We\'d had some problems with the engineer though... the first engineer walked out in disgust because we wouldn\'t listen to anything he had to say. We were trying to mute the drums so they didn\'t sound like rock drums, and he was saying \"That\'s terrible, that\'s not rock & roll!\" We said \"Well, we hate rock & roll.\" He said \"It doesn\'t sound natural.\" We said \"That\'s exactly what we want.\" So he left.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Was that a common problem in the studio? People not getting it?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Oh, it was ridiculous. Unbelievable. We\'d been very lucky because those few months in Wales doing Isn\'t Anything with Dave Anderson, that\'s when things really worked. And then the rest of that record was done in eleven days in the shittest studio you\'ve ever seen. It was a basement studio, really awful, but luckily, the guy working there didn\'t care. He just said, \"Whatever you want to do, do it, I\'ll push the button.\" He was just sat there reading Lord Of The Rings. He didn\'t even mind when we broke his foot.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">You broke his foot?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: The studio was so bad the speakers were up on the wall on a little shelf, so you had to stand up to hear them, and when I was doing the bass to \'Feed Me With Your Kiss\', we turned it up too loud and it blew the speakers off the shelf. And he reached out to catch one in his hand, and by pure instinct he put his foot out for the other one and it landed on his ankle. So he couldn\'t walk the rest of the time we were there, he just sat there with his broken foot reading his book.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">And he didn\'t get pissed off?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Not really. It wasn\'t our fault his speakers were on a crappy little shelf.</p>\r\n<p>But it was nice, overall. And we couldn\'t recreate that later when we were doing Loveless, it was terrible, which is how we got into banning everyone from the studio. If I can\'t work with someone I like, I\'ll work with no one. Alan Moulder came down, then later Anjali Dutt - they had more of a positive, supportive effect, and they were hired to work with us just so we didn\'t have to work with the studio engineer. But that early period was the nicest, because it was so easy. Everything was easy. Living in squats... then it got very difficult after that, because of circumstances being much less conducive.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Things did seem to unravel a bit around this time...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: We went from being in a free world to not being in a free world. I was going out with Bilinda and we\'d moved into a council flat, with the most psychotic neighbours upstairs who would just throw everything out of the window, like the window was a bin – babies\' nappies and everything. It was a Northern Irish man and a Cockney woman and they\'d beat the shit out of each other every night... terrible stuff going on. So we went from having lots of fun to this world where we were getting a £70 a week wage from Creation – and back then the Enterprise Allowance Scheme was £40 – and our rent was about £50 a week... it wasn\'t working out. And we\'d just turned down two major record deals and signed to Creation for 15 grand. So there was a general sense of \"all I\'ve got going for me is this good record.\"</p>\r\n<p>Those terrible things slow the process down. Don\'t kill it. But they really slow it down.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">They did that...</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Well also, if I\'m not in love with a piece of music I can\'t work on it. It\'s like anything else you fall in love with. You might hate it, but then after that you\'ll love it again. You feel very connected. And if someone says, \"hurry up\", you say, \"Oh, I\'ll go even slower now – really fuck you up. Do nothing, in fact.\" At least, that\'s what I did, certainly around the time of Loveless.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">What were you doing instead?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: You might have seen pictures where Bilinda\'s playing a Fender Jaguar with an orange scratchplate. And no Jaguar\'s ever had an orange scratchplate, so people just assume we put it on. But it isn\'t... it\'s a tortoiseshell scratchplate. But for three or four nights in the studio I locked everyone out, and they thought I was working, but I wasn\'t. I was just really meticulously scratching the top layer off this scratchplate with a razorblade. That took three days. They were my least productive three days. Well actually, they were productive because I had something to show for it, but...</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Does it seem like a very long time ago?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Not really. Well, yes and no. Because I was doing My Bloody Valentine in my head until about \'97, then I hung out with Primal Scream from \'98 to 2005, which was a strange block of time. I was taking drugs – just recreationally, but... a lot. I felt like I was on holiday. I was exploring envelope filters and echo, things like that... that whole seven year period I didn\'t once play guitar with the tremelo arm, I refused to. Like when I did that music for Lost In Translation, they said \"Make it like Loveless\" and I couldn\'t. Didn\'t want to.</p>\r\n<p>Then Patti Smith asked me to do a thing with her in 2006 (The Coral Sea) and we didn\'t rehearse, we just talked for two hours – I understood what she wanted to do, so I spent an hour remembering what I used to do, I did it and that was the record. And on stage was my third hour of playing guitar like that since 1997. And after that I felt I was in another mode again – shortly after that I did the remasters and then My Bloody Valentine got back together and started playing again. So it feels like that period between \'98 and 2005 is over here, and the two bits either side join up. So even though it is a long time, it\'s like a continuation.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Do you ever look back and think \'I wish I\'d done a bit more\'?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: Yes.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Why didn\'t you?</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: That balance of feeling, energy and ideas all together, it didn\'t happen that much. I\'d love to find a way... in fact I\'m hoping I can in this period of time, but I don\'t know if I will. That\'s the sad part. I\'m trying to figure out a way of gaining control over myself. Trying to train myself, like a horse I can ride. Because I feel happier when I\'m more productive. And I would like to be happier, so I\'d like to be more productive. I mean, not doing things is quite soul-destroying...</p>\r\n<p>But Primal Scream dragging me on stage made me less precious about that kind of thing, and Patti Smith had a role by making me play guitar like that again. I guess what I\'m saying is, yeah... circumstances have a bigger effect on my life than any plan or plot I can create myself. I\'ve got my own studio, just down the road from here. And in the ten years I\'ve had it, I\'ve only used it in three of them. The other seven years it\'s been empty. I feel quite sad about that.</p>\r\n<p>But I made a few big promises to myself when I was a kid, about 17. And so far I\'ve managed to keep them. I was discovering all this great music, and I kept noticing this pattern of bands making great records and then tailing off. I thought \"I don\'t want to ever do that.\" If for some reason I can\'t make a great record, I won\'t make a record at all. Because all you get is a little bit of money, which goes really fast anyway. It\'s easier to do nothing and live on nothing than it is to do something and live on something when you\'re running around compromising.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">It\'s better to do nothing than to do bad work.</span></p>\r\n<p>KS: I think so. It\'s like, being on the dole is better than being in a shit job, so long as you\'ve got an interest in your life. Because if you\'re in a shit job you don\'t really have that much more money, and then after a few years your will to live begins to dissipate. The idea that it\'s good to do stuff just for the sake of doing it, it\'s a myth, I think. It\'s a lie. It\'s a very 80s concept – everything, everything being about productivity. The whole underground was about that too: groups were always saying \"do stuff, do stuff, don\'t just sit around!\" Well, I don\'t believe in that. Even though I know it feels brilliant and I love it. I just... don\'t believe in it.</p>\r\n<p>But I\'m happy with what I\'m doing now, with this new record. Half the people are going to hate it, I think, just like people hated Loveless after Isn\'t Anything. They did! People were always coming up to me at gigs saying \"Oh, why\'s it so quiet, why do you have to have a really good system to hear it properly? Why does it sound like this?\" Well, because that\'s how I wanted it. And I\'m sure the same thing will happen this time. But I learnt a lot from the terrible experience of making Loveless, which was like a huge slow motion scream, you know? I\'m staying true to it, not missing the point of things. Not losing the essence of it. Its good, now. It\'s good.\r\n', 'images/mbv.jpg', '2012-05-10', '09:19:00', 'My Bloody Valentine', 3);

(2, 'Mano Sunderesan\r\n', 'Quinn Is Too Real For the Internet\r\n', 'In the early pandemic, the 17-year-old rapper/producer went viral for her spin on hyperpop; now, her new self-titled album looks for a more present life.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">D</span>own this side of America, in Muscogee County, Georgia, there’s no hiding. As I pass through the first security checkpoint, I get a text from quinn: “make sure to go the speed limit. the military police are WILD and they hide in the trees and shit.”</p>\r\n<p>Right now, the 17-year-old rapper/producer quinn and her family live in Fort Benning, a 104-year-old military base on the border of Alabama and Georgia. Her dad is a master sergeant, and in October 2021 they relocated from Virginia, interrupting quinn’s stint at a prestigious arts school. quinn co-ran a music production club there and often got recognized in the hallways for the music she started releasing as a 14-year-old. Now she’s completing her senior year at a school 600 miles away, where there isn’t a real music program and kids get curb stomped out back. (She sometimes gets the same looks, though: The day before, she was recognized by some bros at an on-base festival headlined by Cee-Lo Green and Andy Grammar.)</p>\r\n<p>Every weekend, the tanks fire off practice rounds, punctuating waking life with booms. quinn is still getting used to that. But otherwise, she’s more or less made this place home. On one side of her bedroom, cordoned off by a massive hanging poster of outer space, is her recording studio, where a rack of samplers and DJ gear sits by a microphone and audio interface. On the other side of the room are posters and banners—Naruto, the African-American flag, Motley Crue—some of which she’s splattered in silver with her graffiti tag: “SPIDR.” As we talk, she lights some sage; Daisy, an old, white toy poodle with human-like eyes, chills on the bed.</p>\r\n<p>quinn, formerly known as osquinn, is a certain kind of famous. In the early months of COVID-19, she captivated alt-teens across the internet with stormy songs simmered in the atmosphere of online life. Building on a soup of influences like the trap metal of Sybyr and the switchblade flows of internet rapper saturn, she sang in a flat, fuzzy tone, often pitching up her voice until it lasered into your brain. As singles like “ok i’m cool” took off, she quickly—perhaps unwillingly—became one of the faces of a burgeoning hyperpop scene, amassing a cultish fanbase drawn to her drifting, ephemeral style. This, too, was the shape of hyperpop itself: not the “countercultural sound of the 2020s,” as one writer postulated, but instead a scene that flourished in a pocket of the internet, a microcosm of decentralized culture. quinn says her parents didn’t get it till they saw the streaming checks coming in; they later found out she was trans when she was profiled in a New York Times article.</p>\r\n<p>All the while, the labels kept calling: Universal, Interscope, 300. quinn turned down or ghosted every single one. She was also getting sick of how fans perceived her and her art, lumping her into internet-addled iceberg memes and deifying her. When she decided she no longer wanted to make hyperpop, and made this clear on Twitter, many of her fans pestered her in search of an answer why. For half a year, she vanished from the internet, drifting away from former collaborators and toward the dance music collective Eldia, whom she bonded with over Discord. In 2021, she emerged from her hiatus with a swath of aliases: cat mother for her new jungle tracks, trench dog for her ambient tapes, DJ weird bitch for her trippy mixes. Her ensuing debut album drive-by lullabies felt more like a mixtape, loosely collaging these styles and identities instead of collapsing them into a statement piece.</p>\r\n<p>“I like for people to hear one thing I made, like my most popular song, and then they hear my cat mother shit and they\'re like, ‘Holy fuck, is this the same person?’” she says. “I love when people ask that question. I like to confuse a supporter.”</p>\r\n<p>These days, though, she’s mostly just quinn. Her new album, titled simply quinn, and released via the independent label DeadAir, won’t surprise fans who’ve been following along with her lost-in-the-mix 2022 releases. Soupier and more intentionally arranged than drive-by lullabies, it’s a stew of Soulection swing, chintzy pop, and headnod funk. These songs are warmer, and more handmade than the cold electronics of past records. In quinn’s voice, you can hear traces of the kid who blacked out over saw waves a couple years ago, but they’re faint.</p>\r\n<p>Is this music still about the internet? Kind of—it’s certainly a negation of it. See “warm and fuzzy,” where quinn rambles about her reluctance to show people her music. Or the smooth closer, which is about balancing work—in quinn’s case, being a small celebrity—with being a teenager. In general, though, quinn’s album feels more like a breezy stroll than an endless scroll. On the irresistible “please don\'t waste my time,” she lilts, “Mama said the life I live is just the life of a man, except the gender change just wasn’t part of the plan.” Then, she practically grins: “I’m in a new place, I’m in a new light, I’m where I’ve always wanted to be.”</p>\r\n<p>quinn spends days at a time with her buddy Jarrod (who’s joined us for the day), smokes copious amounts of weed, and listens to almost exclusively hip-hop of the formalist, bars variety—Kool Keith, People Under The Stairs, Apache. The two of them also talk a lot of shit. In my day at Fort Benning, I learned more straight facts about the townies—friends, enemies, lovers, parents, racists, swingers—than I did about quinn herself. After quinn dons a teddy-bear backpack and drapes a keffiyeh over her dreadlocks, they’re eager to show me around the ‘burbs and share all the lore—the resident Scary Guy, who looks like a young Dr. Dre and jokes about having bombs in his backpack; the group of “white thugs” obsessed with NBA YoungBoy. “I remember hearing one of them,” she recalls. “He was like, ‘Bro, if YoungBoy dies, then I die.’”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Baltimore, quinn bounced around the East Coast growing up, spending chunks of her life in Virginia and Pittsburgh and finding community on the internet. (By the age of 12, she was already in an short-lived online music collective with Atlanta firebrand Bktherula.) “Fort Benning is the best place I\'ve lived yet,” she says, as we pass a community recreation center. “Not in terms of quality and the people here, but just because everyone knows each other here. And I got friends here, and I know a lot of people locally. And that’s something I’ve never gotten to feel because… military family, you know?”</p>\r\n<p>Before moving to the neighborhood, quinn and her family stayed at a local hotel, where they shared space with military personnel from around the world. A group of Russian soldiers partied every single night, their din permeating the thin walls, making it difficult for quinn to properly record. Instead, she focused on making beats and spitting freestyles to convey the stress and loneliness she’d been feeling from moving, finishing (and ultimately scrapping) an entire rap album. One thing she recalls are the faces of the Saudi Arabian special forces that wandered the hallways. “They’ve seen it all,” she says, while crossing the street from a convenience store. “They were so monotonous, and it was kinda sad, because they had no soul. I imagine after seeing all that shit you got no soul no more. And you gotta come to the country that did it to you? I’d be so pissed.”</p>\r\n<p>We make our way back home, where quinn scrolls through her music library on the computer, moodboarding the influences on quinn: the compressed-to-death sample chops of an online scene called soul-hop; the “ketamine music” of chipmunks on 16 speed; Ghostface Killah and BADBADNOTGOOD’s Sour Soul; the wonky outsider rap of Massachusetts collective Dark World. The core inspiration for quinn, however, came to her via a renewed obsession with her favorite album of all time, Standing on the Corner’s jazz rap opus Red Burns. You’ll hear parallels between these albums’ jigsawing structure and tone, their current of pan-Africanism, staticky vocal takes, short songs that work best as parts of a whole. “I started getting more spiritual when I started coming out of my depression,” she says. “I was like, ‘Damn, there\'s so much more to life than just, get on Discord.’” She says she gets most of her spirituality from music, in particular citing conscious rap like Ka, Digable Planets, and Al Divino.</p>\r\n<p>Compared to past records, where she sang about fans not really knowing her, her writing on quinn is stripped of a lot of that baggage. This gives her more room to explore new themes, like her relationship with her girlfriend Mal, who can be heard on the SoundCloud-only album track “CUANTOS AÑOS TIENES.” On the gut punch ballad “the trust game,” quinn tenderly explains her philosophy of love in a single line: “I love you for my soul.” The most abrasive moments are almost comically intense, and walk the line between sounding unfinished and feeling alive—like the interlude “i see you,” wherein quinn goes on an unhinged tirade, threatening to break into an unnamed staff sergeant’s house, eat his string cheese, “fuck on his PAWG of a wife,” and key his car. It’s a reminder of quinn’s raw edge, which in its consistency has placed her music in a different realm entirely from the quirky aesthetics of hyperpop.</p>\r\n<p>As the sun begins its slow descent, I drive quinn and Jarrod about 15 minutes off base to South Columbus, Georgia, a college town the two often explore on weekends. “All this shit slave money,” quinn says as we walk by fancy eateries and stores. A man approaches her asking for money and she gives him all $43 in her wallet. We wander down to a promenade by the Chattahoochee River, which traces the Georgia-Alabama border. The rapids aren’t so rapid today, so a few people are cooling off in the shallows. “I would go swimming if I wouldn’t catch cancer right after,” quinn jokes, hopping over a rocky outcrop.</p>\r\n<p>On the way back to Fort Benning, we get lost. Google Maps is useless; entering and exiting the base is finicky based on time of day. I swivel around loop after loop, miss exits left and right, make sharp U-turns in the middle of the highway, all while the late Maryland rapper Goonew is blaring out the speakers. quinn and Jarrod try to help, but they’re having too much fun watching me fail.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, quinn remembers she’s missing her set at the online community Goop House’s new virtual music festival. For a few seconds, she enters the stream, watches her pre-recorded performance on mute, and sees her fans flood the chat. Satisfied with the overwhelming support, she smiles, then puts away her phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Pitchfork: You’ve gone from working with collaborators to being kind of isolated in your process. Does it ever get lonely?</span><p>\r\n<p>Quinn: It honestly doesn’t. I used to wish I had that team of people behind me, but now I do have that support [from deadAir]. I’ve never really missed collaborating with people, because my creative vision is usually one of one. If I get anyone else on this, I feel like I’m just going to commandeer their vision and turn it into mine anyway—so I might as well just work by myself, which is why I’ve declined bigger people working with me. I can do all this shit by myself, and I want to show you that I can, you know what I mean?</p>\r\n<p>One thing I tell people often is that if you really want to blow up, just shut the fuck up. End the social media presence, all that. Just stay to yourself and focus on your music; don\'t even promote shit. Eventually, the rest will just follow suit, and they\'re gonna be like, “Oh my God, who is this mysterious person stirring up all this trouble around this part of town?” One leads to another.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Are you in a place where your old sound just feels like the past to you? Like “ok im cool”—what do you hear in that today?</span></p>\r\n<p>I hear that song as a relic, sometimes a misinterpretation, because people hear that and expect me to still make the same shit now. But its like, nah, man. I was 15 when I made that. “i don’t want that many friends in the first place”—I made a song when I was 14. I didn\'t mean for it to be my most famous one, you know what I mean? That shit blew up within a month.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Do you feel like your fans think of you as something you’re not?</span></p>\r\n<p>I feel like I deserve the credit that I get, although I do not like it when Im seen as a savior or something like that. I do get how I save people’s perceptions of life and stop them from their depression or the consequences of such. But what I don’t like is when people worship me because they’re like, oh my god, quinn saved my life, so now I’m forever in her debt. I don’t like that cult-like ovation. I do remember someone got my name tatted on them; it was a pretty sick tattoo, so I’ll give them credit for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">What do you want listeners to take away from this album that they might’ve not known about you before?</span></p>\r\n<p>The quinn that y’all think I am is not the quinn that I am.

I guess some people are like, oh my god, I thought you were a girl, your voice is so deep, what are you? And I\'m like, whatever you want me to be. I love being seen as androgynous, man. It\'s like I\'m being seen as an Indian god, or a Pacific Islander legend or something like that. It\'s just something about it that\'s just… a being.

(3, 'Ryan Dombal\r\n', 'Dan Bejar Breaks Down the Gloriously “Incoherent” New Destroyer Album\r\n', 'The Canadian indie mainstay on giving in to spoken-word, singing to a younger version of himself, and reaching his Tom Waits era.\r\n', '<span style=\" font-size: 35px; font-weight: 600;\">W</span>hen Dan Bejar and his longtime producer John Collins started plotting a new Destroyer album in the summer of 2020, they set out to make what Bejar calls a “high-energy Cher record.” They imagined an unceasing four-on-the-floor beat going through an entire side of the LP, with Bejar spewing his cryptic musings between the pounding bass hits. “Obviously, that shit didn’t happen,” Bejar says now. “Making something groovy always seems to be the beginning of our conversation, until we realize how not groovy we are.”</p>\r\n<p>The 49-year-old art-rocker recalls the beginnings of what would become Destroyer’s 13th album, Labyrinthitis, while sitting on his couch in Vancouver, his bushy hair curling into tiny tornadoes around his head as rays of light from a window behind him smear through the Zoom frame. Though the record didn’t turn out as originally planned, it still feels restless and, at times, oddly danceable. There are traces of Saturday Night Fever disco and Madchester rave, minimal techno and infinite New Order emotionalism. One song kicks off with the sound of a blaring airhorn. Over top of it all is Bejar, who matches each beat with one of the many voices he’s cultivated over the last quarter-century—and some he’s trying out for the first time. He croons. He hisses. He sort of raps. The singer says the various vocal styles “speak to the really schizophrenic nature of the album, and the dissonance from song to song. I’m not sure these songs talk to each other. On paper, I think that’s supposed to be something I should be worried about, but I’m not.”</p>\r\n<p>For Destroyer’s last album, Have We Met, which was released just before the pandemic, members of the band recorded their parts separately by choice. This time, COVID restrictions forced them to record everything remotely, before Collins was tasked to make sense of it all. “John will take people’s wildest moments and just create whole songs out of that,” Bejar says. “And that’s what happened.”</p>\r\n<p>For all of Bejar’s impassiveness—his public persona is that of a man who’s seen eons of human chaos and is generally over the whole thing—he admits that the pandemic took its toll on him. “Normally seeing social fabric dissolve doesn’t really interest me that much, but I couldn’t get it out of my head.” With slight irritation, he adds that, for the first time in his life, he found himself scrolling through the news every morning, clocking the charts and graphs we’ve all lived by for the past two years.</p>\r\n<p>This unmoored atmosphere seeped into his creative subconscious, and he soon started humming snippets of songs to himself, written in a mean-spirited, cackling voice that he didn’t fully recognize. “Usually, Destroyer stuff is set in a crumbling world, and that decay is a backdrop to some kind of 20th century-style adventure,” he says. “But I didn’t see that in anything I wrote. It was just brittle little blasts of writing—anti-songs, anti-poems, nothing cohesive. I steered into that. Labyrinthitis is supposed to be really disorienting. It’s fast. And it’s incoherent.” He lets out a small chuckle. “I don’t really get comfort from the record.”</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Pitchfork: Let’s start with “June,” which isn’t quite like any other Destroyer song because it ends with you doing this wild spoken-word rap for two-and-a-half minutes. How did that part come about?</span></p>\r\n<p>Dan Bejar: “June” was originally a three-minute song that John just whipped up another three minutes of music for, and then he got some rap off of YouTube—I think it might have been an old A$AP Rocky song—and sped it up by like 60 BPMs and put that on top. I instantly loved it, but I was like, “We can’t just grab this two minutes of rapping off YouTube, maybe I’ll try my hand at coming up with something.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a lot of ways, the spoken-word part was me seeing if I can have a Doors-style “An American Prayer” moment. I did 10 different vocal takes in about a half hour in my garage studio, just shuffling through sheets of paper and spewing things out that looked good at the time. John grabbed the very first one and then started doing strange, Max Headroom-style cut-ups. The plan was to always fuck around with my vocals on this album, but towards the very tail end of mixing, I was like, “John, you haven’t made me sound like a robot yet.” So out of nowhere he began pitching down the vocals, and they started to sound like when they’re shutting down HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Which, obviously, I loved.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">When your vocals begin to go haywire, I remember thinking, Whoa, I did not see this coming.</span></p>\r\n<p>We didn’t see it coming either. I am a real sucker for feeling shocked, or just feeling worried about something I’ve done. I would like to get to a higher place of art-making, but that just works on me.</p>\r\n<p>For the most part, the songs are written words-first—if I can’t sing something from beginning to end before anything happens, there’s just no song. But in a lot of ways, John doesn’t give a shit about the vocals. They’re putty to him, just one more sound effect for him to fuck with, which is exciting.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">What were you thinking when you were recording that part?</span></p>\r\n<p>I was into the writing, but it was just a form I’ve never really done. Being a child of the ’90s, spoken-word is still much maligned in my mind. Like, is this slam poetry? Is this a dramatic reading? Am I an actor? Truth be told, the most shocking thing was how much I liked doing it. Recording it was really liberating ’cause it spoke to my confusion around songwriting. Not that I’m disenchanted with it, but there’s just always been a style of writing that I’ve done that doesn’t get used because my taste in songs is, for the most part, traditional. Up until “June,” that style of music seemed like a no-fly zone. I know there’s a lot of talk-singing out there right now, in a traditional post-punk kind of way, but that’s not something I’m interested in. I also don’t think that’s what I’m doing on the song.</p>\r\n<p>It creeped me out and made me really nervous. But it ended up being the wildest writing on the record and made me think I could handle doing a bunch more of that shit. Though it definitely took me at least half a year to get used to the idea that that song should even exist. I’m still nervous about it, but it’s slowly become my favorite part of the album.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">There are a lot of funny lines in that song too, like, “A snow angel’s a fucking idiot someone made in the snow.” What do you have against snow angels?</span></p>\r\n<p>I have nothing against them. “June” is definitely a song born of the subconscious, but it’s the villain’s point of view. I wanted the villain to be pathetic and laughable, someone who tries to spoil the good time of children. [laughs] Someone who punches down.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">How does the lyric “Everyone’s happy to strike for more pay” fit into that villainous perspective?</span></p>\r\n<p>I don’t really know. I mean, there’s that old Fall song [“C ‘n’ C-S Mithering”] with a line about only striking for more pay. I wasn’t sure if that was a Marxist critique or not; is it a critique that you’re striking for more pay but you’re not striking for a general workers revolution? How does change occur if that’s the only reason? But then that’s a very luxurious critique. Whoever utters that sentence better watch their ass in this day and age, and for good reason—especially a well-to-do, middle-aged indie rock singer-songwriter. [laughs] I thought I’d sing it and see what happens. It’s not a trolling line. It’s potentially academic, which means it is potentially despicable.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I Googled “labyrinthitis” and now know that it’s an inner ear disorder. Why did you choose that for the title of the album?</span></p>\r\n<p>I went through a phase of self-diagnosis, and that was something that came up. I was just like, “There’s something wrong with me.” It’s probably connected to tinnitus, which people who’ve made up loud music for decades get, and it gets aggravated. There’s probably vertigo and dizziness attached to it, or the feeling of being drunk for no apparent reason. That’s where it came from.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">But you’re OK?</span></p>\r\n<p>I’m good. No one wanted to diagnose me with it, unfortunately. I don’t officially have it. But I kept staring at it as a word. It seemed insane to me. It seems so invented, like something that Borges would come up with, or from a weird Lovecraft short story. Does that mean you’re addicted to mazes? It’s not a word I find very poetic. It also has bad electronic music or bad prog metal connotations to it, which I didn’t really mind.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">It kind of sounds like a Tool album title.</span></p>\r\n<p>It does.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Another song that stands out is the album’s first single, “Tintoretto, It’s for You,” with its headbanger-y drums and synth riff.</span></p>\r\n<p>That song felt super foreign to me. When you hear the demo of it, it was supposed to be almost like a Warren Zevon or a Tom Waits song. I’ve been into really schmaltzy ’70s Tom Waits lately. People have been backing away from me since I’ve gotten into my Tom Waits era. A lot of people find that reprehensible these days.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Do they?</span></p>\r\n<p>Not him, but that kind of gravelly, barfly, fedora-wearing guy. But I’m a sucker for it. At least I am in the last few months. We started talking about ways to steer clear of it. The chord progression changed so that the vocals just became completely amelodic, just me ranting over this synth mall-metal dirge that John came up with. But yeah, it’s an ill fit. Lots of people are like, “That’s a really cool song,” but I don’t know if I know anyone besides John who likes that song. [laughs] So I was like, “Fuck it. This is gonna be the first single.”</p>\r\n<p>It was just really enjoyable to write and sing it. I felt like everything after that became very confusing, and almost an attack on the song. Not to compare myself to Leonard Cohen and compare John to Phil Spector, but it felt like a Death of a Ladies’ Man moment, where Leonard Cohen was like, “What the fuck is this shit?” But at the end of the day, I understand where he’s coming from when I listen to Death of a Ladies’ Man. It’s really awkward, but there’s something about that that I find compelling. And John didn’t find it awkward at all. He just thought it was the most righteous thing in the world. There was a light show going on in his mind when he produced that record.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Why did you choose to name-check the Italian painter Tintoretto on that one?</span></p>\r\n<p>It just came to me. The song is about the Grim Reaper, about it being your time to go. It’s just death talk from beginning to end, and I wanted to place an artist at the center of that drama. It might be one of the only times I’ve ever written a song from the title down.</p>\r\n<p>I associate Tintoretto with me faking my way through a conversation about art; visual art interests me in a social sense, but compared to music, film, or reading a book, it doesn’t have the same emotional impact on me. I had a vague recollection of me throwing around Tintoretto as a painter I liked in my 20s, just such utter bullshit. It’s totally like young Dan Bejar to pick a semi-obscure Venetian painter. For some reason the name haunted me that way, just as an emblem of my own portentousness. Of something you reckon with decades later, when death is knocking on your door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\"> “The States” is one of the album’s more mysterious-sounding tracks, with touches of techno and ambient drone. It also includes lyrics about going to Montreal and Spain, two places where you spent time in 2001, around the time of Destroyer’s Streethawk album.</span></p>\r\n<p>“The States” is one of the only autobiographical songs I’ve ever written. I’m 100 percent singing to a younger version of myself, from 20 years ago, which is not something I’ll probably do again anytime soon. It has a lot of imagery of abandoning your life and being in some weird bus depot. I kept thinking about memories of getting across the border, and how young bands had to come up with some story in order to go to the States to play music. And just the general feeling of being young and feeling like you were on the lam. It’s so far away now that it seems like a different version of myself. You sing it, but it kind of exists in this mist.</p>\r\n<p>I felt like it was an innocent song in that way, and maybe that’s why I wanted to spice it up a bit and try and make it sound like Depeche Mode. Maybe I was feeling a little self-conscious about it being too revealing. Not that it reveals a lot, but it doesn’t take much in Destroyer canon to be called “revealing.”</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Speaking of your former self, the album’s finale, “The Last Song,” sounds like the type of guy-with-a-guitar song that could have been on one of your earliest Destroyer cassettes.</span></p>\r\n<p>I definitely don’t know where that song came from. It’s the last song that I wrote. I haven’t written one since. I just needed to cleanse myself. [laughs] I needed to sing a song. I needed to touch an instrument. It just felt like a from-the-heart song. I don’t write a lot of them. I wanted a song to end the album that would turn its back on the album, or even the last two or three albums. I’m not saying I’m gonna pick up the guitar and start writing folk songs, but I wanted a song that addressed sadness in a head-on way. Writing songs with a guitar is part of what I do, even though I have this antagonistic relationship with it. It’s what I first did in 1995, when I got up on stage and said, “This is a Destroyer concert.” Sometimes I just need a reminder of what it is that I do in its most essential form.\r\n', 'images/destroyer.jpg', '2022-03-09', '10:23:00', 'Destroyer', 3),
(4, 'Jazz Monroe\r\n', 'For Post-Rock Octet caroline, Everything Is Up for Debate\r\n', 'In this Rising interview, members of the expansive British band discuss the folk traditions and feelings of hope behind their music.\r\n', '<span style=\" font-size: 35px; font-weight: 600;\">T</span>wo weeks before the biggest show of their lives, the experimental folk octet caroline squeeze into a south London rehearsal space the size of a pub bathroom, shuffling around to accommodate incoming bandmates. Amid the stream of trumpeters, flautists, and violinists, the core trio—Casper Hughes, Jasper Llewellyn, and Mike O’Malley—confer in the far corner. The founding three, all 29 and promiscuous with their instruments, are reluctant bandleaders, forever dreaming up ways to usurp their authority and make caroline an autonomous, eight-person democracy. </p>\r\n<p>They debate nearly everything as a group, including the particulars of the imminent show, at Hackney’s 750-seater EartH Theatre. They interrogate the setlist, optimal song lengths, and matters of “mic complexity.” They propose, peer-review, and revise plans for the rehearsal itself. A faint buzzing is detected, despaired over and, to everyone’s relief, eradicated. After 40 minutes of this, all at once, caroline settle, ready to belt out some lugubrious noise. Nearly.</p>\r\n<p>“Shall we... turn off the lights?” ponders O’Malley. He sounds unsure how this will play, but probably knows full well it is a winning suggestion. Some bands hype themselves up with bravado, but for caroline, uncertainty—fallibility—is the life force. In its manners and music, the band embodies the manifesto for a late-2010s performance art project co-founded by Llewellyn: “No teachers, no students, no hierarchy.”</p>\r\n<p>As impatient instruments hum and honk, O’Malley’s lighting proposal is debated. Is it really worth the fuss? Are there even enough sockets for their mood lights? Haven’t they dithered enough already? It is, and there are, and they haven’t. O’Malley rummages beside the drum kit, produces two antique lamps, and plunges us into a reverent glow. </p>\r\n<p>At the heart of today’s practice is a new song, tentatively titled “When I Get Home,” which begins with a circulating choral refrain. The idea is to introduce spicy instrument pairings—a clarinet, say, sputtering over scattered drum claps—that will guide that opening mantra toward a frenzied finale. At no point should the trance be broken; every element is contentious. Hughes chews over a proposed vocoder layer. O’Malley frets about timings. Is the pause between each repetition too long? Yes. “Everyone wants you to speed up,” Llewellyn, the softly imposing lead singer, deadpans. To cue each oncoming wave, O’Malley devises a system of yanking up his guitar neck and sweeping the room with a stare. The band drills the elegy for nearly an hour before breaking for cigarettes and pizza. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Llewllyn, to his bandmates’ regret, once gave an interviewer a perfect tagline for caroline’s tender, declamatory style: “sadboy triumphalism.” Their earthy emo/post-rock hybrid is a scrappy meld of Low and the Dirty Three, pairing self-aware melancholy with the camaraderie of campfire song. </p>\r\n<p>Depending on the room, a caroline show might also feel like a vigil. I first saw them live last year, in Lisbon, at a shabby venue plastered with Portuguese antifa stickers. They set up among the crowd, performing in the round; violinists Magdalena McLean and Oliver Hamilton started things off with a folksy duet that, approaching merriment, tripped on razor wire and plummeted into a modernist squall. Llewellyn, wailing shipwrecked pleas, alternated between drums and cello, or plucked at his derelict guitar, its strap fixed with a loop of string. O’Malley squatted, coaxing drones from a harmonium. At one point, like a lobster realizing his pot had boiled, he leapt to his feet and throttled a scherzo from an electric guitar. It was the last night of the tour, and when the show ended, the eight of them laid down their instruments and concertinaed in for a group hug.</p>\r\n<p>I meet O’Malley, Hughes, and Llewellyn for the first time several months later, at a pub in southeast London. Beside the chipper Hughes and affable O’Malley, Llewellyn’s shaved head, abundant ear piercings, and sapphire blue eyes give him a striking and vaguely severe air. But the three musicians share a lightness and emotional attention. They ask questions about each other’s parents. Talking about the band, they avidly call out misremembered facts and unconscious lore-making.</p>\r\n<p>Llewellyn and O’Malley grew up a few towns apart in the south coastal region of Sussex. Where did they meet? Llewellyn remembers not; O’Malley does. Llewellyn, ashamed, asks if he was rude.</p>\r\n<p> “Maybe 10 percent aloof. But not rude.”</p>\r\n<p>“That’s standard,” says Hughes. </p>\r\n<p>“I’m surprised it’s only 10 percent,” Llewellyn concedes.</p>\r\n<p>Hughes was raised an hour’s drive west of them, in the commuter town of Farnham. He devoted his teens to skinny-jeaned UK indie bands, until his dad steered him towards Radiohead’s In Rainbows and the oeuvre of Pink Floyd. The mental image reduces his bandmates to giggles. “A little record called Dark Side of the Moon,” O’Malley intones as Father Hughes. “Prepare to have your mind blown, son.”</p>\r\n<p>In the same period, O’Malley was already an “obsessive music cataloguer,” burrowing from third-wave emo into murkier finds like Sparklehorse. “Stuff I still think is cool,” he says. “But I was also really into prog metal.”</p>\r\n<p>“Because he’s a virtuosic guitarist,” says Hughes, with a little irony.</p>\r\n<p>“Did you learn guitar by playing solos?” asks Llewellyn.</p>\r\n<p>“I got bored of solos. I was into really fast, complicated riffs. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I don’t understand now why it felt good to listen to.” </p>\r\n<p>“It must have been satisfying that you got it, even though you were quite young,” reasons Llewellyn. “If I’d understood complex music like that, I’d have felt really good about myself.”</p>\r\n<p>Llewellyn dabbled in metalhead endeavors as a tween but soon became obsessed with indie-pop artisans the Maccabees. In his rural hometown of Lewes, acoustic guitars were a ubiquitous convenience—he recalls singalongs on stoned camping trips by the town’s chalk pits—and his taste “got progressively more quaint,” he jokes. The lodestar, to his retrospective dismay, was Mumford and Sons, who struck him as a British Fleet Foxes or Bon Iver. </p>\r\n <p>“It was easier to covertly appropriate, as [Mumford and Sons] did, because there wasn’t much going on like that,” he says of the dust-bowl cosplayers. “They got lumped in with bluegrass and country artists that me and Mike loved, like Old Crow Medicine Show. In retrospect, they’re from different worlds. One has come through that route, and the other is appropriating an aesthetic that they ditched when it wasn’t useful.”</p>\r\n<p>Before caroline emerged, Llewellyn and O’Malley belonged to a ragtag crew of Sussex folkies. They honed a ramshackle brand of “drunken Appalachian folk”—including a dubious cover of Queen’s “Fat Bottomed Girls”—at local weddings and, during a pair of campervan adventures, on the streets of Europe. When the outfit ran its course, a second caroline prequel took shape in 2016, when uni friends Llewellyn and Hughes made some recordings for fun while holidaying in France. They moved to London and booked shows at New Cross pubs, barking out post-punk inspired by the cult Montreal outfit Ought. As the U.S. Primaries dominated that fall’s news cycle, the usually quiet Hughes transformed himself into a polemicist.</p>\r\n<p>“I wasn’t talking about Trump, but the stakes felt higher, and being overtly political felt apt,” he says. “That’s why there’s been this growth of speak-singy bands. I’m glad we don’t do that anymore, because I don’t have it in me.” One song used jarring guitars to mangle words lifted from a Neo-Nazi rant, “not in the punk sense of trying to shock, but to say: This is fucking happening.”</p>\r\n<p>“It was showing it again in another context,” Llewellyn elaborates. “We talked about it a lot. It was a serious thing.”</p>\r\n<p>“Then I came in,” O’Malley says, grinning. “Fuck the political. Have you guys ever heard of prog? There’s a lot of fantasy elements at play...”</p>\r\n<p>In 2017, when the leftist politician Jeremy Corbyn surprised pundits by making gains in a UK election, the narrative shifted. The caroline we now know stirred to life. As the trio began expanding into the thriving democracy it is today—collecting players ad hoc from their extended friendship group, as the songs required— they wrote the signature tune “Good morning (red),” which appeared on their self-titled debut last year, about the promise of Corbyn’s movement. Instead of rallying for social collapse, the song’s ascendent, twinkly thrums envisaged the new dawn.</p>\r\n<p> “The political mood was one of hope—the idea that, structurally, things could change for the better,” says Hughes. “That didn’t just manifest itself in the lyrics, but also in the experimentalism. I do think that wave of optimism has had a wide impact on culture and music.” That sense of artistic adventure can inspire social change, he says. “You think, how has this been constructed? That’s politically interesting.” </p>\r\n<p>When Boris Johnson’s Conservatives crushed Corbyn’s Labour in 2019, focus returned to fostering local communities and building systems outside government, including within music. Hughes acknowledges rising awareness of streaming economics and dodgy label models, and would like to see musicians who earn “tiny fucking crumbs” return to collective action and “agitate for an assertive class politics.” </p>\r\n<p>Without a belief this might in fact happen, caroline could be doomed. “The idea of doing some sort of commercial venture as an eight-piece band is insane,” says Hughes. </p>\r\n<p>“Making this sort of music, and then having eight people,” Llewellyn adds, chuckling.</p>\r\n<p>“You couldn’t dream up a scenario where you would earn less money. But everyone is irreplaceable.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fortnight later, eight pairs of wide-leg trousers billow onstage beneath EartH Theatre’s steep auditorium. So rapt is the crowd that a security-intercom crackle, or a tiptoeing toilet-goer, can send a frisson through the room, jolting us back into the material world. Folk principles gird the ethereal experience. For the new song, “When I Get Home,” Llewellyn brings up a horde of young acoustic guitarists from the crowd, who encircle him on wooden chairs and learn the chords in real-time.  Though Hughes ended the show with an emotional kiss-off to caroline’s debut, they will bring it on the road for another round in North America this spring, ushering in the band’s second phase. </p>\r\n<p>As the auditorium empties, band members stack gear by the stage door. Is there a system for loading the van? “Just biggest stuff first,” says Llewellyn, lugging his cello downstairs. He turns to appraise my helping hands, carrying dainty keyboard cases. “So that’s probably...” He grasps for a tactful word. “Small?” </p>\r\n<p>Outside, shivering in a thin jumper, Llewellyn reflects on the concert and band—on the whole precarious enterprise. Where Hughes spoke passionately about politics, Llewellyn is more circumspect. For him, the performance is a social ritual built on little acts of faith. The trumpet will sing, and the cymbal will crash, the instant you lash the cello. </p>\r\n<p>“There’s something fundamentally moving in that fragility,” he says. “So many micro cues and spaces being stretched. Things hanging on a precipice. It’s always teetering a little.” The rest of the band has dispersed, heading off for early nights and day jobs. O’Malley and Llewellyn, a quarter of an empire, jump into the van with their precariously stacked cargo and, safely tucked inside, peel into the chaos of the city.\r\n', 'images/caroline.jpg', '2023-02-03', '14:52:00', 'caroline', 3);

Jack Nicholson tries to disappear and start his life over, and the punchline is that he can\'t. For me that\'s how capitalism works — none of us are totally culture-free, and all of us on some level are sentenced with having to relate to society whether we side with it or not. All music is world music -- music is a way of dealing with reality -- the same system that ignores you can also reward you if you\'re willing to push it around and break rules and experiment with it. Commercialism isn\'t as much evil as it is sneaky and shapeshifting.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">What do you think of \"experimental\" music that has no message or political underpinnings behind it, then? Reading into what you\'re saying about commercialism, even the most vacuous pop music would have some cultural significance if only because it\'s interacting with everything inside our cultural bubble. I remember getting into an argument with someone over this pop group The Pipettes from a few years ago. They had a line like \"I dont care what the song\'s about, I just want to dance\" or some shit, and I kept insisting that even a message like that has a strong political \"vibe.\" But I\'m not entirely sure.</span></p>\r\n<p>For me, the notion of \"fuck art let\'s dance\" is political in that it institutionalizes art instead of mythologizing it... but I can understand how someone might feel that it\'s contrary to the political vibe. The whole either/or setup of art vs. dancing is political though. As an homage to Trevor Tremaine, I\'ll say that I\'m more into the idea of the ATTEMPT, i.e. the force of trying to escape, of trying to separate, of striving towards something confusing or impossible or something like that. Extreme striving pathos is more important than either side of that argument.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I can remember a time in America when artist\'s music being used in commercials was super taboo, which has obviously changed. Maybe a reality has set in that musicians have to survive and carve out a place in a society\'s economy too. Yet there\'s the DIY scene that thrives on handmade releases and probably makes very little money. Do you actually make a living off of music?</span></p>\r\n<p>No, not really, but after reading Insane Clown Posse\'s Wikipedia entry, my faith in DIY is restored. I\'m not sure I could make effective commercial music, because I don\'t actually know how to make \"pro\" sounding music. It\'s like Ween\'s rejected Pizza Hut jingle, except I\'d make some insane Bladerunner-sounding shit. And then it\'s always a question of how much you\'re willing to lose and for how much in return. Even Sonic Youth has their price in a free-market universe. People make their choices. Most of the crust punks I\'ve known were either secretly bankrolled or had other lives where they had video store jobs or whatever. No one I know personally is authentically bohemian, whatever that would mean. DJ Screw might have been, but now we\'ll never know for sure. We all have to survive, but we should remember that the need for money doesn\'t give us carte blanche to make shitty products or endorse shitty companies.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I was also curious about your feelings towards downloading music. I think the DIY scene is in an interesting position in relation to the the filesharing debate, being so removed from profit in general. But obviously if subsequent generations think nothing of downloading everything they want to hear, and if they get over any desire to have a physical package, that will have big repercussions on every aspect of the industry.</span></p>\r\n<p>Totally. It\'s pretty clear that whatever the record industry is doing isn\'t working. My friend showed me a blog that had posted Vybz Kartel\'s to-date sales statistics from his last album -- for some reason \"cassette\" is listed as an option? Anyway, it\'s just a bunch of zeros next to all the formats and then an eight next to digital downloads. Eight. It\'s mostly funny to me when considering how much money his people spent on the album campaign etc., and the result could be easily trumped by Whatever Tapes from Anytown USA. The point of the story is that if you build it, they will come. Treat your work like Work, with a capital W, put in the time, and good things will happen. In terms of production and distribution, it\'s never been a more level playing field than as it is now. Everyone\'s going hog wild putting stuff out DIY style, which is radical. As far as illegal downloading is concerned, I\'ve never understood the debate. The internet is a giant free-promotion machine. If shitty MP3s + JPGs are enough for people, it\'s not my job to convince them otherwise. Share away. I\'m stoked on stuff like Waffles because it sounds like people are sharing FLAC rips with good metadata and high-quality scans there. I didn\'t get into music to fight piracy or rally against the digital sea change. The bottom line is, whatever you\'re gonna do, whether it be pirating stuff, or making art — just do it well.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Okay, let\'s get back to your music. Do you find yourself still influenced by new stuff? Or have you reached the point where your own process and work is almost self-sustaining and you don\'t really need to fuel the creative juices from outside sources?</span></p>\r\n<p>No, I\'m a sponge, and I love culture and the process of soaking it in is just as rewarding as working from the inside-out and making my own ‘unique\' work — really, I don\'t see those processes as separate. Recently I\'ve been super into game theory and Halo and Second Life — like on an armchair level... but it\'ll inevitably morph into a video or music project. I don\'t understand people who refuse to listen to music while they\'re recording because it stifles their creativity. I\'m more in the Burroughs camp of everything as a mimetic virus -- like I enjoy getting that bug.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">This might be a good spot to ask about David Keenan\'s Hypnagogic Pop tag discussed in [this blog post]. Do you consider your music a part of that label?</span></p>\r\n<p>I definitely see strains of David\'s ideas in what I do, especially in the videos. I don\'t think the hpop tag is representative of a movement or constituted by a select group of artists. I see it more as a discussion about nostalgia and its subliminal effects on culture. I don\'t see anything wrong with the tag — it\'s just a way of engaging with a phenomenon. In terms of intellectual engagement with underground music, I think Keenan is putting in the hours and doing the Work, and that\'s more than most can say for themselves.</p>--\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I\'m curious about your process of creating music.</span></p>\r\n<p>I jam combos of arpeggiators in latch or unlatched modes, sequencers, and free playing via loopers, and then bounce it to computer where I resample and layer the stuff there. I do this process over and over. It can get really time-consuming and insane. There are other tracks that are kind of antithetical to that process, where I just more or less just straight jam, Danny Wolfers-style or Marcia Bassett-style.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">On Rifts, why did you feel the need to compile the three albums together? Were they conceptualized as a trilogy, or was it more of a marketing choice?</span></p>\r\n<p>I didn\'t realize it was a trilogy until I started working on Zones Without People. There\'s a clear arc from one record to the next. Octagon is about surrendering to the raw sounds of the synthesizer. Zones Without People is a journey through various stylistic approaches to psychedelic music, some of which have traditionally been sort of kept separate from one another — for example stuff like new age and stuff that\'s more like noise. And Russian Mind is a reflection of all my work before it — even stuff prior to OPN in terms of computer-edit electronic music. But if the trilogy ever becomes a film, I have the whole storyline down too, so.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">I love how stark tracks like \"Russian Mind\" are, but inversely, your process seems pretty complicated. Is the goal to try to make something that sounds effortless and almost eternal? Or is that just me reading into it too much?</span></p>\r\n<p>Well, that track is actually really stark and stripped down and wasn\'t complicated to make, although it was complicated to play because I had to actually remember the chord changes which I never usually do. The goal is to make music with the same intensity as Michelangelo\'s sculptures — like beautiful, seamless figures, carved almost violently out of gigantic blocks of super heavy, solid marble. The process of stripping away towards something elemental or burying something elemental within a vast world of sound is something that I\'m into.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Are there any tracks that you consider particularly emblematic of that? Or just any tracks you\'re fond of or think turned out really well?</span></p>\r\n<p>\"Grief & Repetition\" off of Russian Mind is my top dog. It was also the first thing I ever recorded, in 2003.\r\n', 'images/oneohtrixpointnever.jpg', '2009-11-24', '18:42:00', 'Oneohtrix Point Never', 3),

(11, 'Matthew Blackwell\r\n', 'Our Likeness\r\n', 'On her 1992 album, the iconoclastic vocalist and her band of German experimentalists pushed each other to virtuosic extremes, spanning styles and genres.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">I</span>n 1981, a young man sat quietly in Conny Plank’s legendary Cologne recording studio, watching Japanese singer Phew record her debut album. She had been whisked from Osaka to Germany at only 20 years old on the strength of her first single with Ryuichi Sakamoto. Her backing band included krautrock legends Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit of Can, some of the only musicians in the world who the young iconoclast adored. The band decided to improvise, and Phew wrote lyrics on the spot. Miraculously, her voice, though sometimes small and uncertain, gradually found its place amid Czukay and Liebezeit’s bang and clatter.</p>\r\n<p>The spectator during those sessions was Chrislo Haas of German new wave bands D.A.F. and Liaisons Dangereuses. Though he didn’t introduce himself at the time, he contacted Phew almost a decade later in Tokyo to suggest they record together. Haas masterminded the sessions for Phew’s eclectic 1992 record, Our Likeness, inviting Liebezeit back to record with a new generation of the German underground in Alexander Hacke of Einstürzende Neubauten and Thomas Stern of Crime and the City Solution. Now in her early 30s, Phew reprised her role as vocalist in Plank’s studio. This time she came prepared.</p>\r\n<p>The years between Phew’s self-titled debut and Our Likeness, which is now being reissued by Mute, were turbulent but productive. The first Cologne recordings were pivotal for her—she has admitted that she likely would not have continued making music without meeting Plank—but they triggered a period of aimlessness. Encountering Plank’s immaculate studio and his meticulous recording techniques challenged her punk rock ethos. She spent five years reconciling what she observed in Germany with her own simple, go-ahead approach. Meanwhile, her legend grew as the vocalist who recorded with Sakamoto and Can and then disappeared. She returned as a more assured artist with 1987’s View, a poppy, synth-driven affair with relatively restrained, melodic vocal lines.</p>\r\n<p>Though Our Likeness is Phew’s third album, it is the spiritual sequel to her debut. On both albums, Liebezeit’s percussion unlocked the potential of Phew’s vocals across their language barrier. “Music is a language, and the music a person makes is dictated to a certain degree by their mother tongue,” she explained in a 2003 interview for The Wire. “You can hear it particularly in the drumming. Listen to a German drummer and you will be able to detect the influence of the German tongue on his playing.” Frustrated by the constraints of singing in Japanese, Phew catapults her vocals off of the taut platform of Liebezeit’s hyper-precise drumming, twisting and stretching her words with confidence that she will land back in the pocket.</p>\r\n<p>The German experimentalists transform each track of Our Likeness into a world of its own. The band does its best Liquid Liquid impression on “Our Element” while she barks over their dance-punk groove until she runs out of breath. “Being” is the most surprising song for its big, dumb, heavy-metal riffage, but Phew’s growls succeed in making the track more disturbing than silly. Elsewhere, her lilting, sing-song melody lifts the chiming guitars on “Spring” into sublime, airy territory, setting the stage for Hacke’s soaring guitar solo.</p>\r\n<p>Phew complements Haas and company’s most outré tendencies. On “Smell,” sound effects of water splashing, coins dropping, and spooky sci-fi ambience are punctuated by crashing guitar chords. The track becomes tensely dramatic as each sound contrasts with Phew’s calm syllable-by-syllable recitation, as if some malevolent force is threatening to interrupt a child’s bedtime story. These unstructured moments contrast with the blissful pop of the title track, whose twangy guitars and clockwork drumming build to a climax of Phew’s tightly controlled vocal acrobatics, hovering and twisting above the instruments like calligraphic skywriting. Like a punk-rock Meredith Monk, Phew has tirelessly developed her inimitable singing style for over 40 years, from her late-’70s punk band Aunt Sally to her recent run of solo records. When her 1981 debut went out of print, it was heralded “the great lost Can album.” On her triumphant return to Cologne, Phew stepped out of the shadow of her collaborators and made music that sounded unmistakably her own.\r\n', 'images/phew_our_likeness.jpg', '2023-02-22', '05:23:00', 'Phew', 1),

Here, Lean sounds less interested\r\n                    in\r\n                    hypnagogic pop than classic Britpop.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Lean benefits from the grounding presence of Danish multimedia artist Frederik Valentin, with whom\r\n                    he\r\n                    seems to have found an unexpected kinship. As one-fourth of the thumb-nosing butt-rock group Hard\r\n                    Rock\r\n                    Power Spray, Valentin experienced early success with his edgelord antics, opening tours for Green\r\n                    Day\r\n                    and Bloodhound Gang, joining the Warped Tour, and even releasing a concert-movie-cum-porno called\r\n                    Rock N\r\n                    Fuck. But time has a way of wearing down even the artists most invested in shock value, and Valentin\r\n                    seems to have matured into a respectable avant-garde polymath. Big riffs and dick jokes gave way to\r\n                    loops and reverb, adult film soundtracks swapped for Chris Marker live scores. However unexpected it\r\n                    might seem, the slightly elder Valentin offers a role model for Lean, as the rapper continues his\r\n                    own\r\n                    transition from adolescent transgressive to dignified auteur.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Though the leandoer96 project has grown in scope and confidence with each release, it has remained\r\n                    firmly in the bedroom until now; Sugar World drapes Lean in velvet and syrup, with a lush sound\r\n                    befitting the cornball crooner he plays on the album’s cover. The production is more melodic and\r\n                    uptempo\r\n                    than the sparse compositions and ambient soundscapes of Valentin’s recent years, but he’s\r\n                    nevertheless\r\n                    softened since his punk days, arriving at a singular combination of glam rock and indie twee.

Polished arrangements replace the slapdash Garageband drafts that populated previous\r\n                    leandoer96\r\n                    releases, and tracks unfold like miniature suites. At once hard rocking and sweetly melodramatic,\r\n                    Valentin’s treatment positions Lean as a Bowie or Bolan-esque figure, a chameleonic icon shifting\r\n                    into\r\n                    his blue-eyed soul period. “Nightmare Amusement Park” effortlessly glides from guitar-heavy power\r\n                    pop\r\n                    into a glistening symphony as Lean’s own voice oozes in and out of Auto-Tune. On “Open (Copenhagen\r\n                    Freestyle),” Lean is in pure piano-ballad mode, before a talkbox-like guitar joins in to duet.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    There are still traces of a lo-fi sensibility—Valentin generally favors a simple drum machine over\r\n                    full\r\n                    percussion—but the freeform warblings of the leandoer96 project have been molded into a new shape.\r\n                    The\r\n                    jangly keys and sweeping strings of “Rivers of Another Town” channel Camera Obscura, and the clean\r\n                    lead\r\n                    guitar of “If I’m Born I Have to Live” has an echo of Phoenix. At other moments, Valentin and Lean\r\n                    flirt\r\n                    with a classic FM radio sound. The opening bars of “Nightmare Amusement Park” riff on Kiss’\r\n                    “Strutter,”\r\n                    while the guitar solo on the title track blazes into “All the Young Dudes” territory.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Just as he once played the rapper, Lean has searched for new characters to embody, and here he\r\n                    summons\r\n                    his inner wedding singer. Abandoning his monotone rap flow, Lean stretches into the upper reaches of\r\n                    his\r\n                    register, the cracks and chokes of his unvarnished voice offering an evocative counterpoint to the\r\n                    blushing twinkle of Valentin’s production. On “Swedish Elvis Storm,” he reaches an angelic falsetto,\r\n                    swaying like a doo-wop crooner standing on a corner. Some of his lyrics still mimic rap bars—“When I\r\n                    was\r\n                    a young one/Got my head sprung”—but Lean’s writing conforms to pop structure more than ever,\r\n                    distilling\r\n                    it to a refined simplicity. There’s still an occasional clumsiness to the phrasing and delivery, but\r\n                    he’s learned to exploit that as a vehicle for an almost adorable earnestness, serenading the unseen\r\n                    lovers in his phone. Lean’s accented voice achieves a distinct emotional affect, where stumbling and\r\n                    half-uttered words stand in for a broken heart.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    What skeptics misunderstand about Yung Lean is that his appeal was never solely about irony: It was\r\n                    about a kind of dissonance between the profanity and imperfection of Lean’s lyrics and the dreamy,\r\n                    frequently gorgeous production that served as a backdrop. Lean was always drawn in by the sublime,\r\n                    but\r\n                    he offset it with the juvenile deflection of a kid uncomfortable with sincere emotion. Over the last\r\n                    decade of his career, he’s struggled not only to be taken seriously by others, but to take himself\r\n                    seriously as a voice capable of making beautiful noise. With Sugar World, he finally lets all the\r\n                    sweetness and gentle feeling built up inside come tumbling out, stripped of any macho defense\r\n                    mechanisms. While it’s the kind of stylistic switch that might at first seem like another gimmick,\r\n                    Lean\r\n                    lets his heart bleed freely like never before.', 'images/jonatan_leandoer96_sugar_world.jpg', '2023-01-05', '06:32:00', 'jonatan leandoer96', 1),
(13, 'Margaret Farrell\r\n', 'Norm', 'The Canadian musician’s latest album is his most ambitious yet: a lush, cryptic, and creepy suite that questions the very concept of love.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">G</span>od and the devil have preoccupied Andy Shauf’s work since the beginning. Sometimes, he paints sympathetic portraits; on 2009’s “The Devil,” he describes a lovesick Satan, clutching a bottle and weeping over the souls he’s ushered to hell. On the 2012 murder ballad “Wendell Walker,” the title character hears the voice of God urging him to rescue his wife from an affair by killing her lover. For over a decade, these visitations have helped to contextualize the complex characters in the Canadian songwriter’s elaborate storylines. His eighth album, Norm, is his most meticulous and beguiling, straying from his semi-autobiographical past work to span three perspectives and tactfully downplaying its philosophical quandaries with his lushest arrangements to date.</p>\r\n<p>From the social anxiety of 2016’s The Party to the wistful bar-hopping of 2020’s The Neon Skyline, Shauf’s previous concept albums explored the humdrum lives of relatable characters. This time around, the narrators are more unknowable—and, sometimes, all-knowing. On lead single and album opener “Wasted on You,” Shauf writes from the perspective of God and Jesus as two bros brainstorming an idea for their new startup: Christianity. “What happens when they die?” God asks his son in the opening line. “Maybe eternal life? But only if they find me.” As if tossing out ideas in a sitcom writers’ room, Shauf breezes through concepts that have incited doctrinal wars. “Maybe I’ll send you down, give them a clue…. Then they’ll kill you.”</p>\r\n<p>This isn’t a biblical outlier amid more down-to-earth material; it’s the album’s thematic root. With “Catch Your Eye” and “Telephone,” Shauf introduces the main character, Norm, a lovelorn stoner determined to turn his meet-cute fantasies into reality as he desperately stalks his crush from the grocery store. These brief half-encounters—running into her around town, calling her and quickly hanging up—escalate into an alarming routine. Soon, he’s standing outside her window, hiding behind a tree, or trailing her to the theater.</p>\r\n<p>All the while, someone else is following the action: God. When Norm hides in the bushes outside his crush’s house, the Lord watches over him, making sure the leaves cover his shoulders. As the plot thickens with the introduction of the woman’s worried acquaintance and an open-ended, possibly nefarious car ride, Shauf’s romantic inquiries grow more open-ended and existential. By the end of the record, it’s difficult to say which characters come away together or even alive. “What if God didn’t understand what love was?” is how Shauf poses the album’s motivating question. “I wanted to make love songs that were disconnected from romanticizing love,” he told Stereogum. “If there’s a reality to it, it’s that we’re always getting it wrong.”</p>\r\n<p>Narrative twists and divine intervention are not the only tools Shauf uses to complicate his story. Play Norm in the background and notice its unburdened, graceful tone, the easeful glide of the instrumentation. Shauf’s needlepoint vocal delivery, at times reaching a newly unlocked high register, is a highlight. Pastel synths glint through “Telephone” and “Don’t Let It Get to You” like highway lights, while clarinets flutter alongside piano on “You Didn’t See.” The light arrangements evaporate into the air like fragrance, but, weighted with the story’s spiritual ambiguity, each note feels worthy of obsession. Even at their most obscure, Shauf’s songs are as alive and full of mystery as the stranger beside you at checkout.\r\n', 'images/andy_shauf_norm.jpg', '2023-01-02', '08:45:00', 'Andy Shauf', 1),
(14, 'Nina Corcoran\r\n', 'All Fiction\r\n', 'On their latest album, the Boston trio explores an eerie, percussion-heavy sound that maintains the adventurous spirit of their best work.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">W</span>ith their 2012 breakout Dripping, Pile cemented their status as one the loudest, most quietly influential DIY rock bands with riotous live shows and a discography that brawls with post-hardcore. In recent years, however, the Boston group has been plotting a reinvention. Following 2019’s Green and Gray, they released an experimental cassette tape forbidden from being uploaded online, a completely improvised record, and an LP’s worth of reimagined solo versions of their songs. By the time they regrouped as a trio to record All Fiction, Pile were happy to let their identity crisis take the wheel. Forget about the manic guitars or the thrashing momentum of their old songs. Now, Pile are all about minimalist experimentalism and John Carpenter-style synths—a haunting yet jarring twist that ends up exuding the same adventurous spirit of their best work.</p>\r\n<p>Pile cut to the chase with “It Comes Closer.” It’s less than a bang than it is the smoke rising from the barrel of a gun. Piano chords plod quietly while vocalist Rick Maguire sings along to swells of violin and cello. The production has a degraded quality to it, like a demo tape recorded onto another, older tape. This uncharacteristic mood piece sets the scene for an album designed to keep listeners at arms’ length. Big choruses are jettisoned for ambling, uncertain passages. Strings and synths are at the forefront, where they hum with a delicate warmth. Guitar and bass are sparse, and they often sound as if they’re being played on the far side of an abandoned warehouse. The most obvious departure is Maguire’s vocals, which are pushed to the background. His forlorn singing and occasional yells are submerged beneath the music, creating the illusion that he’s buried beneath rubble; whether he’s fighting to crawl out from under it or lays there suffocating in acceptance is up to interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>Pile have long conjured imagery straight out of a horror anthology: spiders crawling up someone’s ass, a ghost trapped inside a human stomach, the unshakeable urge to get dressed and light yourself on fire. For once, Pile lure goosebumps through the music alone. “Link Arms” segues from a three-note piano part straight out of a paranormal film to spiraling violins fit for Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s dystopian panic. On “Nude With a Suitcase,” Alex Molini uses a Rhodes piano and Omnichord to cast an ambient haze that turns downright eerie by the outro. Even when Pile return to traditional rock song structures, like the thundering “Loops” or “Poisons,” the crackling distortion and alarm-like synths build a type of musical claustrophobia. Despite the absence of a clear narrative, All Fiction creates a cinematic portrait of a narrator slowly accepting their sanity is brittle, which makes sense considering Pile drew influence from the tense yet uncluttered scores of There Will Be Blood and Watchmen.</p>\r\n<p>If Pile’s previous albums trained your eyes to follow Maguire, then this one forces you to focus on his surroundings. Drummer Kris Kuss has long been the driving force behind the band’s tenacity. He’s unforgiving behind the drum kit, hitting with aggression but giving off the aura of a gentle giant. On “Gardening Hours,” he turns sporadic drum grooves into a cool, jazzy rhythm that later slows down. The way his anthemic fills turn into a towering beast on “Forgetting” without overpowering the strings brings to mind the astute style of Unwound’s Sara Lund. Even during the album’s interludes, his airy percussion earns the spotlight without trying.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Pile released a stripped-back guitar blues album called Jerk Routine; it’s felt like an outlier in their catalog until now. All Fiction proposes that the trajectory of Pile’s discography is not a line, but a horseshoe. The new album is a similar collection of sparse, atmospheric songs, but it centers around drums and percussion. With Kuss taking the lead, the band settles into a new identity that functions better than expected considering they’ve spent the past 16 years refining what a modern-day rock band could be. Avoiding the clichés of a band ditching their guitars for synthesizers, Pile find a happy medium, approaching the album through inquisitive means and experimental methods to create a similarly intense, albeit quieter, record. You have to bristle and tug at it to get past the barbed wire around these recordings, but once you do, you’re immersed in a surprisingly detailed and evocative world, just beyond the limits of rock.\r\n', 'images/pile_all_fiction.jpg', '2023-02-08', '11:43:00', 'Pile', 1),
(15, 'Stephen Thomas Erlewine\r\n', 'Transmissions From Total Refreshment Centre\r\n', 'Produced in collaboration with Blue Note, a new collection documents some of the artists and sounds emanating from the London cultural institution at the epicenter of contemporary jazz.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">A</span> Parisian whose gateway to jazz and hip-hop was the Beastie Boys, Lex Blondin opened the Total Refreshment Centre in a London warehouse in 2012, creating a space that tripled as a recording studio, artist workshop, and concert venue. Within a few years, the community orbiting TRC became the epicenter of an adventurous jazz scene that couldn’t be confined to Britain. Soon, such acts as the Comet Is Coming and Moses Boyd established an international reputation, helping to seal Total Refreshment Centre’s position in the musical vanguard. </p>\r\n<p>Just as the popularity of Total Refreshment Centre and its associated artists started to crest, neighborhood noise complaints led the Hackney Council to decline to renew its live music license in 2019. The concert stage shuttered but the recording studio and artistic community remained. Blondin and TRC are currently on a mission to popularize the Total Refreshment Centre brand, launching an eponymous imprint and collaborating with Blue Note on Transmissions From Total Refreshment Centre, a seven-track collection featuring musicians associated with TRC. Some of this music was recorded at Total Refreshment Centre, some elsewhere in London or Europe, which means the compilation isn’t so much a chronicle of a scene as a definition of an aesthetic: stylish artifacts repurposed as a vehicle to the future. </p>\r\n<p>In the liner notes, Emma Warren—author of a 2019 book on Total Refreshment Centre called Make Some Space—calls the featured artists “the widescreen young cousins of Guru’s landmark Jazzmatazz,” a reference to the groundbreaking album the rapper released in 1993 after leaving Gang Starr. Guru enlisted such jazz titans as Donald Byrd, Lonnie Liston Smith, and Roy Ayers to record live in the studio, an innovation that yielded livelier results than the British jazz-rap group Us3’s Hand on the Torch, a 1993 record created with free reign to sample from the vast Blue Note catalog. Featuring the U.S. Top 10 hit “Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia),” Hand on the Torch was part of Blue Note’s modernization mission of the 1990s, a project that also produced the Blue Break Beats series, compilations that plucked highlights from funky soul-jazz LPs of the late ’60s and ’70s—and which stuffy jazz fans dismissed upon release.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly 30 years later, sampled loops and the jazz-rap fusion forged on albums like Jazzmatazz are part of the lingua franca of jazz, something Transmissions from Total Refreshment Centre makes clear. None of its juxtapositions are startling; they feel like the natural evolution of a process set in motion years ago. Each track traces a connection to the crate-digging cross-pollination of the ’90s, ignoring perceived borders between dance, experimental, hip-hop, and pop. The proceedings take on a slight air of nostalgia, not for the initial sources but for their rediscovery, the moment when these disparate strands were first tied together. When Miryam Solomon sings sweetly over Matters Unknown’s refurbished bossa nova beat, it doesn’t bring to mind Latin music LPs from the ’60s—it sounds like peak Stereolab.</p>\r\n<p>Transmissions From Total Refreshment Centre is filled with quiet, fleeting moments that vaguely recall something else, particularly if an MC is involved. Soccer96, the duo of Max Hallett and Dan Leavers (who also play in Comet Is Coming), conjure the ghost of Jazzmatazz in a spontaneous collaboration with rapper Kieron Boothe, playing on seedy ’70s funk and hard hip-hop rhythms. Neue Grafik Ensemble—one of the few acts here signed to Total Refreshment Records—team with Brother Portrait on “Black,” a sinewy number that taps into the spookier elements of trip-hop. As trumpeter Byron Wallen intertwines with the sawing drone of Oli Langford’s strings on “Closed Circle,” there are hints of Miles Davis stretching the limits of hard bop just before he delved into fusion on In a Silent Way.</p>\r\n<p>Fusion is at the center of Transmissions From Total Refreshment Centre—not as a musical style but an aesthetic. What’s striking about each of the compilation’s featured artists is how thoroughly they integrate adventurous improvisation to the skittish rhythms. Groove and vibe are present but they’re not the key to the music; exploration is. Even the cheerfully insistent “Isa”—the most conventionally danceable cut—is based on a live improvisation, with Noah Slee overdubbing vocals at a later date. “Isa” is a bit of an outlier, though. Most of the transmissions on this compilation are appealingly monochromatic, such as Resavoir’s clustered, clattering reading of Charles Tolliver’s “Plight” and Jake Long’s “Crescent (City Swamp Dub),” where Tamar Osborn’s elongated baritone saxophone runs give shape to slow, churning funk. This is the experimentation fostered at the Total Refreshment Centre, a sensibility that spilled out into the larger jazz world: alternately smooth and restless, nostalgic yet forward-thinking, both natural and alluring.\r\n', 'images/transmissions_from_total_refreshment_centre.jpg', '2023-02-09', '15:43:00', 'Total Refreshment Centre', 1);

Paired with hazy production, his diaristic words of self-reflection and self-deprecation ring out loud. The London-based singer, rapper, and producer has a knack for vivid storytelling on emotional despair and introspection that serves as makeshift therapy sessions. GLOW, his second project, centers the anticipation and fear of unlocking one’s own potential. This intimate collection of avant-R&B songs wallows in growing pains, embracing late-night anxieties of not feeling good enough for anyone, least of all yourself. </p>\r\n<p>Across the record, Joseph airs stream-of-consciousness musings on fear and hopelessness with apparent ease and warmth, sounding like he’s ready to welcome the confidence to overcome. He first established that vision as a founding member of Birmingham musical collective OG Horse, which also included childhood friend and fellow singer Jorja Smith. In 2016, the Walsall-raised artist moved to London to study film. His 2021 debut, ULTRAMARINE, was soulful and upbeat, but relied heavily on cinematic aesthetics that left its themes of loneliness and longing feeling boring. GLOW is far more evolved.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the project, Joseph’s music evokes a mix of Pip Millett’s gritty neo-soul, Blood Orange’s colorful textural exploration, and SAULT’s funk-inspired melodies. His songs translate deep feelings into futuristic pop and R&B that sounds as sinister as it is grandiose. The project opens with its title track, a five-minute emotional goliath that dissects Joseph’s inner turmoil and desire to be perceived: “How do you see me/When you glow so bright/So bright?” he repeats in a melancholic tone over moody, blue-lit strings. What happens when dark thoughts are so ubiquitous that standing in the light feels like a distant dream? </p>\r\n<p>On “I Just Know Highs,” a Leon Vynehall-produced track that twists Joseph’s eerily Auto-Tuned vocals into a flute instrumental, Joseph examines the personal lows that paradoxically make him feel most alive: “I’m lost out my mind/Well, most of my mind/If I look down I’m dying, or maybe I’m flying,” he croons. On “Cold Summer,” he juxtaposes optimistic bars on moving past self-deprecation against wistful strings that bring the emotional work within reach. GLOW sags at “25,” where Joseph’s personal stocktaking is stunted by a vague and repetitive wish to find “a different side of me.” The song ends abruptly before we find out which side that might be.</p>\r\n<p>It’s the album’s least interesting moment, but the missed opportunity doesn’t overwhelm the breadth of Joseph’s skill to delineate his feelings in a way that evokes comfort and reflection. With GLOW, Joseph underlines the often scary process of uncovering insecurities with a sense of reassurance that suggests your own introspective forays could be just as rewarding. What lies on the other side of fear? GLOW’s warm and encouraging approach to finding the answers makes for a stellar introduction to a multidisciplinary artist dedicated to conquering his own limits.\r\n', 'images/wesley_joseph_glow.jpg', '2023-02-04', '17:45:00', 'Wesley Joseph', 1),
(17, 'Dylan Green', 'Audiodidactic\r\n', 'Seven years after his debut, the Top Dawg fixture returns to his habitual stylistic fusions but too often, his muddy, psychedelic haze fails to summon the dreamlike quality it’s aiming for.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">S</span>ince his career began, Lance Skiiiwalker has been painted as one of a kind. The Chicago-born vocalist and producer, aka Lance Howard, first popped during a weekend trip to Los Angeles, when a friend who managed a clothing store on Fairfax put on one of his beat tapes. Two customers who patronized the store that day happened to be former Top Dawg Entertainment president Dave Free and Kendrick Lamar, who were so impressed with his music that they had the manager call Skiiiwalker back to the store to meet him. He quickly fell in with TDE’s inner circle, becoming a fixture at the Carson house that served as their de facto headquarters, and bringing woozy touches of R&B, funk, jazz, and hip-hop to songs from Jay Rock’s “Money Trees Deuce” to Kendrick’s “untitled 04 08.14.2014.” He was called a “mad scientist,” a “glitch in the system” capable of unlocking a song’s potential.</p>\r\n<p>After becoming something of a secret weapon for the label, Skiiiwalker signed to TDE in 2016 and dropped his solo debut, the warped and hazy Introverted Intuition. It was certainly unprecedented by Top Dawg standards, an album that dabbled in several genres without committing to any. Songs meander from crunchy beat music and wafting R&B to new-age funk; they feel like attempts to buck convention by throwing everything at the wall. But aside from establishing what separated him from his labelmates, Introverted Intuition offered little insight into Skiiiwalker himself. Being freewheeling is one thing; get too untethered, though, and the ideas simply float away, as sweetly ephemeral as vape smoke. Audiodidactic, his first proper album in seven years, following a handful of EPs, trudges even further into Skiiiwalker’s imagination. Every song is awash in a psychedelic haze that misses the very dreamlike quality it aims for; Skiiiwalker sounds lost in a musical echo chamber of his own creation.</p?>\r\n<p>He deserves credit for having honed his craft. His production work on albums like SiR’s 2019 album Chasing Summer and Isaiah Rashad’s 2021 comeback record The House Is Burning pushed Skiiiwalker to develop his piano, vocal, and plugin skills. That dedication informs the album, right down to its title. Through self-teaching and instinctive wanderlust, Skiiiwalker pulls from multiple stylistic corners: neo-soul, prog rock, the 2010s California beat scene. Unfortunately, he’s so determined to throw the listener off his trail that Audiodidactic often feels adrift, the vibes left frustratingly indistinct.</p>\r\n<p>It’s a shame, because in the few places that things come together, Skiiiwalker plays with interesting textures. Audiodidactic’s best moments, self-produced cuts like the shoegaze-esque single “Beantown” or the crisp, futuristic groove of “It Was All,” achieve a soothing mesh of bass, synths, and vocals swirling like quasars. “IG,” another highlight, captures the beauty of smashing punk rhythms and chirpy, muted keys together. The rest of the album tries to stretch across styles but comes out amorphous and bland. Muddy vocals on the Groove-produced opener “Friends” and the title track melt into fields of saxophone and plugin-soaked synths, attempts at collaging that register only as background noise. Many of these songs have pretty melodies (like the Matt Miller-produced “Everybody Hurts Somebody”) but can’t corral them into concrete ideas; instead, they just dissolve into a mush of colors and influences.</p>\r\n<p>Skiiiwalker is a talented musician with good connections who has yet to figure out how to translate his faculties into solo work that amounts to more than a bunch of genres rubbing shoulders for the sake of it. Not that there’s anything inherently wrong with that: Lil Yachty’s recent excursion into psychedelic synth rock and funk, Let’s Start Here, is also a mess of a record, but Yachty’s passion and presence keep things more focused. Texas singer-producer Liv.e’s recent Girl in the Half Pearl is more successful, weaving gauzy R&B, drum’n’bass, and synth funk into a rich tapestry of love in all its forms. Much of Audiodidactic, on the other hand, feels anonymous, like an amalgamation of Robert Glasper, Mndsgn, and Shabazz Palaces songs searching for a binding agent. Until Skiiiwalker can add some more interesting ideas of his own to the mix, it will be difficult to tell where his influences end and he begins.\r\n', 'images/lance_skiiwalker_audiodidactic.jpg', '2023-01-04', '19:55:00', 'Lance Skiiwalker', 1),

Dylan, who was only 55 at the time, read his resulting lyrics to producer Daniel Lanois, who was stunned by their unearthly power, and the pair headed into the studio to fashion a record falling somewhere between a seance and a last will and testament.</p>\r\n<p>Like all of the stories surrounding the creation of Bob Dylan albums, this one bears traces of myth and marketing. Typically, his Bootleg Series either subverts received knowledge (Trouble No More, Another Self Portrait) or magnifies legends (More Blood, More Tracks, The Cutting Edge). Fragments might be the first release that manages both. The series can feel overwhelming by design or aimed only at the highest-security-clearance Dylanologists, but Fragments presents us with a clear chronology: Disc One gives us the final studio album, remixed and scrubbed fresh so we can avail ourselves once more of its glorious shadows and submerge ourselves in its delicious mood. The remaining four discs—two of unreleased outtakes, one previously available, and a live set—repositions Time Out of Mind as a rebirth rather than a farewell.</p>\r\n<p>What becomes abundantly clear over the course of the set’s six hours is that Time Out of Mind is primarily the story of a mood, and one ensemble’s single-minded pursuit of it. The making of this album was protracted, painful, and in all ways alive, and the album’s dour countenance was largely the product of theater and shadow. Dylan, ever the role player, was inhabiting a persona, slipping into a black jacket and working the character for fresh angles. Lanois accentuated the gloom and submerged the album in a damp chill of effects pedals and reverb until Dylan seemed to be speaking to us from the beyond. But—as the new mix on Fragments underlines—his baleful pallor was stagehand’s makeup, the gushing blood just red silk scarves.</p>\r\n<p>The story began, appropriately enough, in a picaresque old playhouse Lanois dubbed the Teatro, filled with storybook touches—cob-webbed 16mm projectors, dusty mirror balls. Dylan and Lanois started with looping jams inspired by Charley Patton’s old 78s. Accompanied by bassist Tony Garnier and drummer Tony Mangurian, they built the tracks on top of those primordial beginnings. The mighty, roaring sound that emerged spooked everyone to attention: “The hair on my arms went up,” recalled sound engineer Mark Howard.</p>\r\n<p>But Dylan, predictably, wasn’t settling in. He couldn’t work this close to his home and his family, which, by now, included six children and multiple grandchildren. They decamped instead to Criteria Studio in Miami, a space with a hallowed history (Aretha Franklin’s Young, Gifted and Black, the Allman Brothers’ Eat a Peach) and the ambiance of an airport security detention center. Lanois, shrugging, packed up all of his priceless tube microphones and moldering tape loops and relocated without complaint to this concrete box. But it was the beginning of a split between the two that would define and nearly overwhelm the sessions. The two stubborn visionaries seemed destined to remain at loggerheads. Lanois rarely spoke to Dylan before and after takes, and entire days unfolded in icy, uncomfortable silence.</p>\r\n<p>Dylan, meanwhile, seemed determined to complicate things as much as possible. He reportedly felt haunted by Buddy Holly, and in tribute, he created his own ghostly version of the Crickets, pulling from his touring lineup, session-player royalty, and beyond. All in all at least 12 musicians found themselves crowded in Criteria, with Bob Dylan as their bandleader (“Two of everything, like Noah’s Ark,” marveled pedal steel guitarist Cindy Cashdollar). Dylan would try songs out in different keys, abruptly switching in the middle and expecting the band to remap their own chord progressions without a moment’s hesitation. The playbacks were a disaster, musicians crashing audibly into one another as they struggled to adapt. Lanois, listening with Howard, knew that he might only have a few shots at catching each song before his tempestuous leader grew bored and moved on, so he ordered musicians to simply not play if they couldn’t navigate the changes.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever else was happening in the studio, the musicians achieved a rambling, spacious, loose cohesion. Guitar lines seem to be on the verge of wandering entirely out of sync with the drums only to fall in on beat with a satisfied breath. These are not driving rock numbers, and yet they were three or four drum kits rolling away at any point. The music came on like a big, black thunderhead, rolling forward with guitar echo merging into a clatter of drums.</p>\r\n<p>The unreleased outtakes on Fragments reveal some of the extraordinary moments they littered along the path. On Disc 2’s take on the folk standard “The Water Is Wide,” Dylan leans into the performance as if he might reach out and touch the shoulder of his beloved. It’s as devoted as he ever sounded, and behind him, Garnier and Mangurian play so subtly and understated they register as lighting. Disc 5 gives us the original haunting take of “Can’t Wait” that raised Howard’s arm hairs: Over a hard backbeat, Dylan’s block piano chords and impressively tasty riffing from Lanois, Dylan chews the scenery with the unhinged glee of a Shakespearean actor let loose in a Hollywood blockbuster. The song is mesmerizingly dark, but hearing Dylan bite down with panther’s teeth on “I’m getting old,” it’s easy to conclude that he was feeling nothing but the opposite.</p>\r\n<p>The extra discs yield the usual Bootleg pleasures: The Disc 2 version of “Cold Irons Bound” features stunning alternate lyrics about “stones in the pathway hurled” and “clouds of blood,” while the live versions of “’Til I Fell in Love With You” and “Standing in the Doorway” inflect the songs with sinewy hints of roadhouse blues, soul, gospel. But the true glory of these recordings is witnessing session legends like Mangurian, Jim Dickinson, and Bucky Baxter—giants whose playing pushed the blood through the veins of American song—sound momentarily lost, reverent, uncertain. The performances on Fragments surely represent some of these players’ most unguarded and searching work. Years later, they still spoke of these sessions with a mixture of anxiety and awe.</p>\r\n<p>This lingering unease points to what makes Time Out of Mind special in Dylan’s discography, maybe even singular: More than almost any of his studio albums, it was the product of cult-like group obsession. Everyone from Lanois to Dylan to the phalanx of hired guitarists behaved like people gripped by a shared trance. Sessions stretched to 10 hours while Lanois drove Dylan to try “Not Dark Yet” again in E-flat, then in B-flat, until Dylan finally snapped, “If you haven’t got it now, you ain’t getting it.” Whatever their disagreements or tensions, everyone toiled under the mutual assumption that there were spirits in this material, ones that only they could coax out.</p>\r\n<p>Their struggle centered on two songs—“Not Dark Yet” and, ironically, “Mississippi,” a song written for and left off of the final album. There are multiple versions of both songs littered across Fragments, and it is fascinating to hear them expand and contract, changing shapes and keys and tempos. For Dylan, the song had always been the thing: His catalog had always boasted the folk virtues of pliability. You could speed his songs up, slow them down, throw rock drums behind them or do any old thing, and the songs would remain, somehow, themselves: “Desolation Row” remains recognizably “Desolation Row” on take 5 and Take 13. But something different happens to “Not Dark Yet” and “Mississippi” when the players fiddle with them: They become different songs.</p>\r\n<p>Listening to the evolution of Time Out of Mind’s most beloved song, “Not Dark Yet,” shows how these lurching, unsteady sessions wound up yielding their particular exhausted glitter. The first alternate take is in a different key, sending Dylan’s voice into a higher register and the song into ill-fitting sunlight; it’s a harmless little ramble. The second take, on Disc 3, is slower, and in the same key as the final version. You can hear Dylan’s voice settle into the tired languor that defines “Not Dark Yet.” But although you get a tantalizing glimpse of its potential, the view is blocked by a marching-band triplet fill on the drums and some Hornsby-esque piano trills. It doesn’t feel gloriously endless, as it does in the final studio version; it simply feels long. It wasn’t until the band stumbled into lockstep, all musicians’ frills burned away, that the song’s dark shadow loomed into view.</p>\r\n<p>But the story of Fragments—the story of the album Time Out Of Mind isn’t, but almost was—rests with “Mississippi.” No song undergoes so many fitful revisions. On Disc 2, it’s an uptempo, zydeco-inflected rocker. On Disc 3, the band works it into a gut-wrenching funk that Lanois loved but Dylan rightfully discarded. The definitive version of “Mississippi,” which wasn’t released until 2008 and included on the fifth disc, is suffused with air and light. If “Not Dark Yet” sounded like it was in the beginning stages of evaporation, “Mississippi” felt like fumes itself—far too ethereal and light for Time Out of Mind.</p>\r\n<p>Dylan, with his typical foresight, understood this implicitly. This is why he saved “Mississippi” for 2001’s Love & Theft. Critics and fans hailed that one as a rebirth: here, seemingly, was Dylan riding high, Time Out of Mind’s Edgar Allan Poe rags tossed off in favor of a natty bowler hat and a riverboat gambler’s mustache. But Fragments reveals the truth of the matter: The man who croaked about walking through “streets that are dead” already had his glittering blue eyes on the next horizon.\r\n', 'images/bob_dylan.jpg', '2023-01-09', '11:19:00', 'Bob Dylan', 1);

(19, 'Jayson Greene', 'The Untold Story of Elliott Smith’s Teenage Band\r\n', 'The singer-songwriter became famous for a style so intimate it resembled confession, but six recently unearthed albums made with his high school friends trace the surprising musical path he took to get there.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">B</span>ack in 1985, Elliott Smith was just Steven Paul Smith, a shy new kid entering his sophomore year at Portland’s Lincoln High School. He soon befriended a small group of fellow music obsessives, and over the next four years, this tight-knit crew recorded six albums of original material. The songs on these records have a lot of… everything: sections, lyrics, time signatures, guitar solos, era-appropriate keyboard sounds. One track, 1986’s “Laughter,” crams more of all those things into its bulging nine minutes than most Rush albums do in their entire runtimes. These homemade epics were released on cassette and distributed locally—which meant that for a brief period in the mid-1980s, if you went to one of the band’s shows or frequented the right record store, you could buy one of these tapes and listen to it on your stereo. </p>\r\n<p>Decades later, when Smith was an acclaimed solo star giving interviews to major music publications, this idea seemingly kept him up at night. Whenever these recordings were mentioned, he dismissed them relentlessly. “I really promised myself a long time ago I would keep [them] from ever seeing the light of day,” he laughed when asked about his high school albums in 2003. He didn’t even want to share a band name with the interviewer for fear someone might “dredge it up.”</p>\r\n<p>Well, someone has—or rather, the combined forces of fanbase curiosity and passing time have forced the recordings into light. Now, Elliott Smith diehards who know what to search for on YouTube can hear these records for themselves. Although judging by the videos’ current view counts, this music, made by a teenaged Smith with his friends, is still very much hiding in plain sight.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that the recordings now exist online is in large part due to the efforts of a group of remarkably persistent superfans. One of them, a Dallas-based 20-year-old named Cameron McCrary, fell in love with Smith’s music and then became obsessed with the idea that there were a half-dozen albums, written and recorded in part by his hero, that were virtually unknown. “It was crazy to me that that just existed, and it was sitting out there,” McCrary says. “Most of it wasn’t online; no one really wanted to talk about it.” </p>\r\n<p>McCrary took it upon himself to unearth each of the original cassettes, emailing record stores in and around Portland for surviving copies and putting up entries for the albums on Discogs as a kind of bat signal. The Discogs page attracted the notice of Smith’s high school friend Tony Lash, who produced and played drums on many of these records. Lash tried to sell his surviving copies of three of the albums to McCrary, but McCrary couldn’t come up with the cash. Instead, the young fan referred Lash to a fellow Smith completist, who bought all three along with lossless files of a fourth, in the fall of 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The other two albums trickled in over the next two years, and McCrary and his friends posted songs to YouTube in fits and starts. By May 2022, all of the albums were available on YouTube, though few seemed to notice. “Even among Elliott Smith fans, no one knows they exist,” McCrary marvels. </p>\r\n<p>The recordings are alternately endearing, astounding, and confounding, full of surprises big and small. For one, young Steven Paul Smith was a bit of a guitar god, and song after song features blistering, peeled-off solos. Did you ever imagine what Elliott Smith might sound like singing over a punk-funk groove? Behold 1989’s “Small Talk,” where he grunts “The phone is busy, her legs are naked” over whammy-bar wails and a Jane’s Addiction-meets-Red Hot Chili Peppers strut.</p>\r\n<p>One has to imagine these were the moments that an adult Smith imagined seeing resurface in his cold-sweat nightmares. And yet, across these six albums, there is far more than adolescent embarrassment. For one, there is a song called “Condor Ave,” from 1988, that’s a near note-for-note predecessor of the famous song that would appear on Smith’s debut solo album, Roman Candle, six years later, with different lyrics. Other tracks conceal revelations behind unfamiliar titles: “Catholic” turns out to be a prototype of “Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands,” from Smith’s 1998 major label breakthrough XO, with him singing alternate lyrics in a plugged-up Elvis Costello bleat over distorted guitars. And “Three” is an early version of the eerie masterpiece “King’s Crossing,” off 2004’s From a Basement on the Hill, released a year after Smith’s death. </p>\r\n<p>Alongside endearing youthful follies and nascent versions of later Smith solo songs lie startlingly excellent lost gems that stir impressions of the majestic songwriter he would later become. In the descending stacked vocal harmonies of “Asleep,” you hear the seed of Smith’s sublime a cappella chorale “I Didn’t Understand,” the closing track from XO. On “Take a Fall,” a lifetime study of the late-Beatles harmonic language suddenly snaps into focus, and you hear a young Lennon-McCartney disciple suddenly become Elliott Smith. </p> \r\n<p>Once you make it past the surface-level impression—awkward kids making awkward stabs at rock music—these six records upend pretty much every received notion about who Smith was, what motivated him, and how he worked. Above all, craft mattered deeply to him, even at low points when it seemed that very little else did. These tapes bring that quality to the fore, presenting Elliott Smith the tinkerer, the woodshedder, the perfectionist.</p>\r\n<p>But the bittersweet irony of devoting yourself to craft is that mastery renders your work invisible. By the time his self-titled 1995 record was released, Smith found himself fielding questions about whether his scraped-raw lyrics were autobiographical. At every opportunity, he redirected interviewers away from personal interpretations and toward questions about craft. “I’m not interested in making ‘Elliott Smith records’ over and over again,” he said in a 1999 profile, amid talk of his music’s gloomy rep. “I’d be really happy if I could write a song as universal and accessible as ‘I Second That Emotion.’” He may have become an icon for perfecting a lonely, resonant style so intimate it resembled confession, but these albums show, for the first time, the bumpy path Smith took to get there.</p>\r\n<p>“I want people to see them as belonging to the rest of his work,” McCrary says. “I don’t think he would have turned out to be who he was if he hadn’t recorded them.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith and his friends recorded these teenage opuses between the years of 1985, when Smith was a gawky 16-year-old, and 1989, when he was studying at Hampshire College and in the process of forming his first well-known band, Heatmiser. The groups that created the six albums went by several aliases: 1985’s Any Kind of Mudhen, 1986’s Waiting For the Second Hand and Still Waters More or Less, and 1987’s Menagerie were all credited to Stranger Than Fiction, whereas 1988’s The Greenhouse was credited to A Murder of Crows, and 1989’s Trick of Paris Season to Harum Scarum.</p> \r\n<p>The group of friends behind these records included future Heatmiser drummer Tony Lash; Jason Hornick, who would play in early versions of Heatmiser before splitting off for med school; Garrick Duckler, a bookish and intense intellectual with white-hot aesthetic convictions and untold pages of potential song lyrics; Glynnis Fawkes, a future New Yorker cartoonist and graphic novelist who drew art and snapped photos for the albums’ covers; and Susan Pagani, a budding writer and theater kid who provided lyrics to a few of their compositions and dated Smith for the better part of junior year. The crew formed a clannishly intense bond. Even as their lineup shifted slightly—Hornick’s friend Adam Koval subbed in on drums for Menagerie and Waiting for the Second Hand—the core group remained unusually committed, spending countless hours laboring over their music.</p>\r\n<p>Duckler, Hornick, and Smith met early on in their sophomore year. “We were both really quiet, introverted kids, and we realized we were into music,” recalls Hornick. Currently a professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School and the director of Surgical Pathology and Immunohistochemistry at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Hornick has curly silver hair and kind, crinkling eyes; even at 53, it’s not hard to imagine him as the eager, nerdy teenager he was back then.</p> \r\n<p>Within a week, Smith brought his acoustic guitar to Hornick’s parents’ house, and they began playing music in his bedroom. Both had been writing songs alone, and they started to share their work with each other and offer suggestions. “We listened to a lot of Beatles,” Hornick says, especially “Strawberry Fields Forever” and “I Am the Walrus.” “The way Elliott structured some of his songs had similar ideas, like the bassline walking down stepwise beneath the chord changes, which he loves to do.”</p>\r\n<p>Hornick and Duckler had previously met at a Jewish youth camp, where they bonded over their mutual love of Billy Joel and new wave, and made plans to start a band together. Responding by email, Duckler remembers hearing about this “guy named Steve” from Hornick, who cautioned him: “He looks… different. He has holes in his jeans and he might like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.” Duckler says he and Hornick were surprised by Smith’s “emotional intelligence” and “incredible observational abilities.”</p>\r\n<p>Today, Duckler is a practicing psychoanalyst in Portland. He says trying to remember the exact moment he met Smith, who became a lifelong adult friend, is like asking for “single moments about your dad or mom.” The first concrete memory Duckler has of Smith is when he once suddenly stopped on the stairs, turned to face Duckler, and observed, “You have a deep voice.” “He said it as if he had just found $20 on the ground,” Duckler remembers. “It felt like the opposite of an accusation.” </p>\r\n<p>Duckler began dating Fawkes in their sophomore year, and they stayed together through to the end of high school. She remembers Smith as “very quiet, mostly with his head down, with that slow smile,” she says fondly. In a creative writing class, she contributed a cartoon to a class newspaper project called Death Quarterly in which an illustrated Smith went to sleep with an earring in, poking a hole in his waterbed and sending up a geyser.</p>\r\n<p>Susan Pagani was in the same Russian class as Fawkes, Duckler, and Hornick. She started dating Smith—her first boyfriend, who she refers to only as “Steve,” the name she knew him by—at the close of that sophomore year, right around the time she and her family were relocating from Portland to San Francisco. The couple connected, ironically, at Pagani’s own going-away party, where Stranger Than Fiction played.</p>\r\n<p>“We were in the basement, hanging out in the half light,” Pagani recalls over the phone. “You know the moment when you talk to someone and just know that you’re going to be friends? I’d had it with my girlfriends, but talking to Steve was really the first time I’d felt that way about a boy. We were both lonely kids. He was really kind, open, and funny.” With a laugh, she adds, “This is maybe too much information, but I just really liked the way he smelled.” At the end of the night, Smith told Pagani, “Well, it’s too bad that you’re leaving in three days.”</p>\r\n<p>Pagani spent her last day in Portland walking around with Smith and friends, eating pizza and talking. “He gave me his address on the sticker of a Maxell tape cassette with ‘Sir Gillette’ as his name, and I drove off to California in a VW Rabbit, which broke down in Death Valley,” Pagani says, recalling that she called Smith from her family’s motel room, “the kind that has a quarter slot by the bed to make it vibrate.”</p>\r\n<p>From then on, Smith and Pagani were in a long-distance relationship, racking up hefty phone bills and writing each other long letters several times a week. At one point in our phone call, Pagani pulls out an old mixtape Smith made her that year, which included Elvis Costello’s “Talking in the Dark.” “We would be on the phone for hours,” she says. “I would lay on the floor with my stereo on and listen to music with him. We would tell each other our favorite parts and then rewind and fast-forward through them. We definitely were in love.”</p>\r\n<p>The crew’s first album, Any Kind of Mudhen, features Fawkes’ rudimentary sketches of six chickens on its cover. That album was mostly sung and recorded by Smith and Hornick. “He was programming this really awful drum machine called Dr. Rhythm,” Hornick recalls. “The cymbal just sounded like noise. I wish we had those recordings without the machine, because some of the songs were really nice.”</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, where later cassettes veer all over the stylistic map, into Zeppelin-esque hard rock and tough-talking Clash impressions, Any Kind of Mudhen features a batch of songs with music and lyrics entirely by Smith—including “Joy to the World,” “Pbida,” and “To Build a Home”—full of the unadorned tenderness, acoustic guitar, and hushed vocals that would go on to characterize his solo recordings, right down to his fragile tenor. </p>\r\n<p>Even then, Smith’s songs were filled with private meaning. Pagani provides the key to “Pbida.” The word is a transliteration of the Russian рыба (pronounced “reba”), which means “fish.” “For some reason, I was obsessed with fish at this point in my life,” she explains. “Any time she had a chance, Glynnis would slip a rubber fish into my locker. When I left town, I sent Steve a paper chain of fish, which he then hung from his light. And then he wrote that song.”</p>\r\n<p>As for the rest? Well, look no further than “It Was a Sunny Day,” a seven-and-a-half-minute, spoken-word goof featuring Duckler-penned lyrics like, “Her hair shone in the midnight sun/Just like the frog on the all-beef patty,” while Hornick and Smith cackle audibly in the background. “There was a lot of hysterical, non-stop laughter,” Hornick says. </p>\r\n<p>The band had already recorded Any Kind of Mudhen when Tony Lash entered the fold. He was a year ahead of the rest of them, and met Smith in band practice, where Smith played clarinet and Lash played flute. The two connected over their love of Rush. With the drummer on board, the young musicians could indulge their penchant for long, complex, multipart compositions.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>On 1986’s Still Waters More or Less, they dove into the deep end. With offerings like “Song to the Great Serpent” (“Oh great serpent, sleek and wise/Gaze upon us with snaky eyes”), it is likely the album everyone involved spent the most time fervently wishing would go away. </p>\r\n<p>“I can hear so much ambition and abandon in those recordings,” Lash laughs now. “There are so many notes and so many lyrics—just a lot of information. I went through my own phase of embarrassment [about it], but we were 17- and 18-year-olds in the 1980s.” </p>\r\n<p>“There was a lot of cheese,” acknowledges Duckler. He recalls, with affection, the “sheer grandiosity of being 16,” when you have “the kind of overconfidence that comes from knowing almost absolutely nothing about life or the world.” An unabashed nerd, Duckler’s interests at the time included everything from Kafka to playwright Harold Pinter to satirist and puppeteer Stan Freberg to Randy Newman. “Elliott and I definitely did a lot of hating of this material for a long time,” Duckler says. “But then one day he just said, ‘This time [in high school] was so creative! I don’t think I’ve ever been that creative.’”</p>\r\n<p>During this time, Duckler fell under the spell of movements, like Futurism, that purported to be the final word on art. Accordingly, as the band’s primary lyricist, he filled his notebooks with manifesto-worthy paragraphs of essentially unsingable text, with which Hornick and Smith would grapple gamely. Highlights include the hilariously strident “The Vatican Rock,” which tasks Hornick with delivering lines like, “God gives us the bomb, and that decision/So our power’s his, with imperialism/Treat thy neighbor as thyself/Well not Central America, but everyone else” over a 12-bar blues vamp, chants of “Go, Johnny, Go,” lifted straight from Chuck Berry, and, at one point, an honest-to-God tap-dancing solo, performed by a friend. “We wish her timing had been better,” Lash jokes.</p>\r\n<p>Pagani provided lyrics for two songs: “The Crystal Ball” and “The Roller Coaster to Hell” came from letters she wrote to Smith. “I was dashing off letters to him with pieces of ideas and stories all the time without worrying about it,” she says. “Which is a gift, really—I had a friend in my life who I didn’t worry about sharing everything with in that way.”</p>\r\n<p>Listening to all of these recordings now, the sense of runaway creative ferment, of youthful abandon and glee, is what comes through clearest. “There was no fame, no recognition, no need for applause, no worries about how to make rent,” Duckler remembers. “It was, in my opinion, a time for [Smith] that was much more bereft of the self-consciousness and worries that came later.”</p> \r\n<p>Whatever else you hear on a monstrosity like “Instinctual Disjunction”—I swore I heard a melodic quote from “Live and Let Die” or “Scenes From an Italian Restaurant” (or both) somewhere in its nine-plus-minute runtime, but I may have grown delirious—these six albums offer the joy of hearing Elliott Smith with friends, immersed in music-making purely for its own sake. These recordings represent him when he was perhaps his happiest and most fulfilled. </p>\r\n<p>Somehow, the group rehearsed and mastered these turn-on-a-dime epics in rehearsal rooms during lunch or in between periods. After school, they would trudge over to a friend’s house to record, doing live, full-band takes as often as possible, before adding vocals later on. “Looking back at how complicated some of the songs are, it seems insane we were able to work them out with so little rehearsal time,” says Lash. </p>\r\n<p>Slowly, word began spreading throughout the school about Stranger Than Fiction. Duckler remembers when one kid turned in his seat during math class to express his admiration, in great detail, to a flabbergasted Smith for a borrowed Zeppelin riff in one of their songs. “It blew [Smith’s] mind,” says Duckler. </p>\r\n<p>There were even gigs: Lash recalls a somewhat-uncomfortable performance in the school auditorium (“It wasn’t music [designed] to quickly win over an audience”) as well as at a private school’s annual concert, alongside poetry readings. They played at Fawkes’ house, clearing furniture away to make room for their gear. Incredibly, Stranger Than Fiction even went on to play a homecoming dance, performing originals alongside covers, including several by Bob Dylan, the shambling “Positively 4th Street” among them. Hornick also recalls with some mortification that “Abacab” by Genesis made the set list, as well as some Beatles songs.</p>\r\n<p>Though their material was not at all high-school-dance-friendly, Hornick remembers, “People were so excited to have us playing. Everyone knew who we were.” The portrait that emerges is of a group of teenage misfits who were nonetheless at ease in their wider environment, treated by others with affection and respect. Fawkes mentions that she and Duckler were on the ballot for homecoming royalty (“If that was ironic, I don’t know”) and sums up the group’s dynamic succinctly: “We were nerdy, but we didn’t feel like nerds.”</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, they all concede with distance that they took their music unusually seriously. The process of writing and recording consumed them, occupying all their time together, and none of them seemed to question such commitment. “When you’re a teenager, you have this soupy, plastic identity,” explains Lash. “You’re not in the process of making a big developmental story. You’re just with your friends.”</p>\r\n<p>Fawkes agrees. “When you’re 16, you don’t know what else there is in the world,” she says, adding that she sometimes looks back at this time in wonder, as if it weren’t her living these memories but someone else. “Who are these people?” she laughs. “It seemed like a lot of fun.” </p>\r\n<p>Fawkes confesses she got bored of feeling like “a fifth or even sixth wheel” during band practices and eventually drifted away from the enterprise, but she and Duckler have never lost touch. Fawkes and Smith developed their own private friendship during their high school years, speaking on the phone about their lives and families. She remembers Smith obliquely telling her about the path his life had taken from Dallas to Portland, and his turbulent upbringing. Her clearest memories of Smith are touchingly, endearingly normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any high school kids, the group would often wander aimlessly. Fawkes remembers Smith stopping in front of an “Orthodontics for Adults” sign and starting to belt those words out, over and over. She also recalls a Halloween party where she ran around with Smith and Duckler in a cemetery: She wore an Egyptian costume, and Duckler was in a big David Byrne suit. Smith, dressed as a vampire, kept repeating two phrases he’d learned in French: “I’m a vampire” and “I throw my innards at you.” </p>\r\n<p>“We thought everything was hilarious,” says Hornick. The group would get stuck on a phrase, something that would strike one of them as funny, and then it would circulate endlessly, spiraling in hilarity until the mere mention of it would send them all into fits. Hornick says a reliable standby was when Smith would say the phrase “ducky boy soup” and then pretend to stick his hand through Hornick’s stomach. “That’s all he had to do, and we would all be hysterical.” </p>\r\n<p>If the overly complicated arrangements and occasionally stiff lyrics tip the band’s songs into pretension, the albums’ liner notes testify to their ever-present sense of play. They are full of inscrutable in-jokes—the special thanks section of 1987’s Menagerie mentions “peanut udder,” “earrings,” “explosions,” “a muck,” and “a sip of glory.” </p>\r\n<p>As for the numerous band-name changes—from Stranger Than Fiction to A Murder of Crows to Harum Scarum—Duckler says they were “perhaps the least relevant thing” about the projects: “We joked we were just trying to lose our enormous fanbase.” Aliases appealed to Smith’s inner trickster: Once he was in college, he alternated between names like “Elliott Stillwater-Rotter” and “Johnny Panic.” Duckler recalls a moment later on in their friendship when Smith gleefully showed him a credit card made out to “Elliott Smith” with a small “aka Steve” appended. It’s possible that a lyric from his 1995 classic “The Biggest Lie”—“And now I’m a crushed credit card registered to Smith/Not the name that you call me with”—obliquely memorializes this moment. </p>\r\n<p>All of his old friends laughingly struggle with exactly what to call Smith: Despite establishing his intention to refer to Smith as “Steve” early on in our call (“because that’s who he was in high school”), Hornick slips easily and unthinkingly into “Elliott” many times, while Duckler’s email refers to him once as “Elliott/Steve.”“He really did love an alias,” Pagani says. “It wasn’t surprising at all when he changed his name.” Duckler associates Smith’s love of pseudonyms with “a longstanding terror about being trapped in himself, trapped in his own history.” </p>\r\n<p>Even after Smith graduated Lincoln High School in 1987 and headed to college across the country in Massachusetts, the friends managed to record while home on breaks. The results of these sessions were two tough and snarling albums, 1988’s The Greenhouse and 1989’s Trick of Paris Season, that boast a stronger Costello influence as well as some truly wild guitar theatrics; the latter also marks the first appearance of the name “Elliott Smith” in the liner notes. The chunkier rock sound stemmed in part from the super-charged amp Smith borrowed from a friend, and it ironically dates the music more strongly than the tinny Dr. Rhythm drum machine from 1985’s Any Kind of Mudhen. Nonetheless, there is no mistaking the sense of confidence and mastery—the swagger—in these recordings: By this point, Smith, Duckler, Hornick, and Lash had been working together for five years. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What these albums reveal, above all, is the degree to which the recorded persona “Elliott Smith” was just another alias, albeit one that grew problematic and suffocating as he became famous. Before he fully embarked on his solo career, he had already apprenticed himself on nine full-length albums. He’d tested out how it felt to play wailing guitar leads, figured out how his voice could sound both rough and sweet, and tried every conceivable variety of rock song. So when he sat down in the basement of his girlfriend and manager JJ Gonson’s house in 1993 to record the hushed demos that would become Roman Candle on his Regal Le Domino guitar, he was bringing a literal lifetime’s worth of songwriting lessons to bear.</p>\r\n<p>Take Roman Candle’s “Condor Ave,” a cryptic, allusive song about abusive relationships and complex webs of codependency. Smith’s lyrics depict a woman fleeing a possibly-violent altercation with a man, heading out into the night in her Oldsmobile before crashing into a drunk man’s car, killing them both, leaving the song’s narrator (possibly a son) grieving: “I don’t know what to do with your clothes or your letters.”</p>\r\n<p>For fans versed in the complicated details of Smith’s family life—his contentious relationship with his stepfather, Charlie, and his concern for his mother, Bunny—the song has always carried hints of autobiography. Condor Avenue is a real street in Portland, the city where Smith lived with his biological father Gary, his stepmother Marta, and two of his half-sisters. Bunny and Charlie, back in Texas, would occupy a dark place in Smith’s songwriting imagination for years to come—the song “Waltz #2,” from XO, depicts in part the stifling effect an overbearing patriarch has on his wife and her child. The details in “Condor Ave” didn’t align neatly with Smith’s story, but on some subconscious level, they seemed to rhyme.</p>\r\n<p>And yet it only takes one listen to the original 1988 version of the song to dash this impression completely. The melody and arrangement, by Smith, are virtually identical. But it was Duckler, not Smith, who wrote the lyrics, which tell an entirely different story, albeit with many of the same lines. “My version is pretty wordy and contains a lot of elements of the child’s perspective of a mother’s death or, probably more precisely, disappearance,” Duckler says, adding that he wrote the song from the perspective of a young girl.</p>\r\n<p>Smith’s version shows him to be a surgical editor, able to pick out Duckler’s teenaged turns of phrase (“into rhythmic quietude,” “screen door like a bastard back and forth”) while burning away their adolescent portentousness. “Cotton candy, lost my shirt at the fairgrounds” becomes “a sick shouting like you hear at the fairground,” while Duckler’s line, “It is said that you should never lose your mind when a moth gets crushed/Because the light bulb only loved it half as much” becomes, “They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed/Unless a light bulb really loved him very much.” </p>\r\n<p>Whatever else Smith’s version is—a revision, a variation—it isn’t, in any way, plagiarism. Duckler’s original reads like a would-be parable, whereas Smith’s hints directly at the kind of darkness that swirled through his songs like shadows. It is a precocious child’s idea, given adult weight. It is a conversation between friends, between adolescence and adulthood.</p>\r\n<p>Duckler says he didn’t mind Smith borrowing his phrases, but remembers a radio interview in which Smith was asked about “Condor Ave.” “He didn’t really mention its early origin, or me, which I felt was kind of lame,” he admits. “He didn’t even know (or seem to know) that Condor Avenue is a real street in Portland, where my brother’s law office used to be, and forms a string of lights you can see from Reed College campus, which is where I was when I wrote the song.” </p>\r\n<p>But none of this really matters, Duckler adds, because Smith made it his own. “Much later on, he told me he was never sure how to thank me in any of the albums because there were lines and phrases of mine,” Duckler reflects. “But I said they felt like they were really reflections of how interconnected we were, and not that they were such precious phrases of mine that needed credit. He was relieved and said he felt the same way about what they symbolized to him. So that made me feel I was still important to him in some way. I certainly never felt my words were better or even that worthwhile. But I think our friendship was worthwhile—as difficult as some parts were.”</p>\r\n<p>Duckler and Smith remained close, even though they were on opposite coasts: Duckler stayed in Portland to attend Reed, just 15 minutes away from Lincoln High School, while Smith ventured to Massachusetts’ Hampshire College. Hornick, meanwhile, got into Amherst, only a mile away from Hampshire, and visited Smith often, even playing in an early version of Heatmiser. He recalls a show at Hampshire’s The Red Barn with a shock-prone microphone and a set that included a version of Cheap Trick’s “I Want You to Want Me,” with Hornick and Smith trading lines. </p>\r\n<p>Eventually, Hornick went to L.A. for med school, although he would go see Heatmiser whenever they were touring nearby and hang out with Smith. They were still close when Smith went solo, Hornick remembers. “He sent me a recording of [Roman Candle] around the same time he was releasing it, and I loved it. For me, it was an extension of what we had done together for so many years. But more than that, they were just perfect songs.” Hornick says he and Smith eventually drifted apart around 1999.</p>\r\n<p>Like Duckler, Hornick also experienced the strange deja vu of hearing their teenage work come back to him on Smith’s studio albums. Back when they were both juniors in high school, barely able to drive, Hornick sat down with Smith and wrote a darkly flowing melody on his keyboard and then chose what he calls a “silly pseudo-horn” effect as a setting. Meanwhile, Smith sang Duckler’s lyrics, characteristic mouthfuls that rhymed “lipstick” with “masochistic,” and “didactic” with “prophylactic.” Toward the end, Duckler lit on an indelible line: “Now I’m a policeman, directing traffic/Keeping everything moving, everything static.” They called the song “Fast Food” and slapped it on the second side of 1986’s Waiting for the Second Hand. </p>\r\n<p>Fourteen years later, when Smith was in Abbey Road Studios, recording the follow-up to 1998’s XO, he dug out this old tune, revamped it, and polished it. When he put it on 2000’s Figure 8, the song had been retitled “Junk Bond Trader,” and it reached Hornick’s ears startlingly intact: The phrasing and harmony of the keyboard melody were identical, transposed to piano and harpsichord, as were the crying melodic turns that went behind the verses. Smith had rewritten nearly all the lyrics this time, keeping only the “policeman, directing traffic” line from the original, but he mimicked Duckler’s breathless verbosity. It is the most disdainful and teenaged song on Figure 8—maybe in Smith’s entire solo discography. </p>\r\n<p>At the time he wrote it, Smith was disgruntled, struggling with his major label contract with DreamWorks. What does it mean that, at this moment, he turned to a song from his high school friends, reframing it as a spiteful portrait of an artist devoid of inspiration, going through the motions to satisfy a business agreement? Like all of Smith’s gestures, it grows only more complicated and opaque the more of the backstory you seemingly “know.” </p>\r\n<p>The speculative shadows swirling around a song like “King’s Crossing,” the centerpiece of Smith’s posthumous 2004 album From a Basement on the Hill, also feel eerier when you factor in the original version, called “Three,” with lyrics by Duckler. What did it mean for him to replace Duckler’s ominous warning, “You take too many sleeping pills/You know what happens” with the more fatalistic, “I’ve seen the movie/And I know what happens”? Or when he changed Duckler’s “Gimme one good reason why you do it” (hilariously, in Duckler’s song, the “do it” refers to paying taxes and filling out a W-4 form) to the gunshot-in-a-theater loud “Give me one good reason not to do it?” There were few answers in Smith’s music, and the only person in the world who knew precisely what the songs were about was him. </p>\r\n<p>For Hornick, the reappearance of their youthful music occasioned only good feelings. “I loved that [our songs] could continue to have a new life,” he says. Hearing “Junk Bond Trader” was like Smith saying hello in a language only they spoke, a shared vision from his father’s attic being realized, in spectacular fashion, at Abbey Road Studios. For a couple of kids who first bonded over their obsession with the Beatles, it was a dream beyond imagining. “It made me so happy. So profoundly happy.” </p>\r\n<p>Fawkes attended some of Smith’s Heatmiser concerts after high school, but as his career went forward she fell away from his circles and had only a passing familiarity with his solo music. She remembers watching him, flabbergasted, on Saturday Night Live in 1998. She hasn’t revisited the high school albums in years, although she still has them. “There’s something so intense about hearing these that I almost don’t want to,” she reflects. “There’s some way that I feel like I can’t pay attention to this yet, as if it’s not ready yet for me to pay attention to.” Behind her reticence I sense a certain hesitance to disturb what remains an idyllic memory, perfectly preserved in amber, with any of the shadows of her present-day self. “It was an intense time in high school,” she says quietly.</p>\r\n<p>For everyone I speak to, this distant past is still remarkably present, and the language is very different from what you might expect from someone in their 50s reminiscing about their high school band. “I was listening to the song ‘Cypress,’ and I thought, Oh wow, this really stands up to anything he wrote later,” says Lash. “I had a new appreciation for it.” It’s clear that they all still think about this material, and maybe some small part of them yearns to still be working on it, believing it might be perfected. “Going back and listening, I’m pretty blown away,” says Hornick. “With a little more work, some of it could have really been wonderful.”\r\n', 'images/elliott_smith.jpg', '2023-03-02', '14:32:00', 'Elliott Smith', 4),
(20, 'Dan Charnas', 'The Obscure J Dilla Beat Tape That Changed Music Forever\r\n', 'Long before Donuts, a passed-around cassette made the Detroit producer a key influence on the sound of hip-hop and soul. The author of the celebrated Dilla Time takes us inside the making of this legendary tape.\r\n', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">W</span>hen fans and critics attempt to induct the uninitiated into the wonders of  J Dilla, the beat producer who died 17 years ago this week, the commonly recommended collection is 2006’s Donuts. It is, by far, his most famous album, in part because it’s his epitaph, finished while he languished in a Los Angeles hospital bed and released three days before his death. The 31 clipped instrumentals carry no vocals save for the ones Dilla extracted and manipulated from his copious sample sources; this lent a posthumous air of prophecy to the project and led listeners to extract messages from the sonic mayhem. Donuts was influential in its jagged approach to sampling, bringing fracture to the fore of hip-hop and spurring the careers of beatmakers like Flying Lotus and Knxwledge.</p>\r\n<p>But as great as Donuts is, there is a more obscure piece of collected work that best illuminates the ongoing influence of James Dewitt Yancey: a humble beat tape created eight years prior, when he was still going by the name Jay Dee. Unlike Donuts, which also began as a beat CD, this collection was never officially released—and likely never will be. A number of the tracks were sold as beats for other artists’ songs years ago, and most contain samples that have not been cleared. You can find parts of it here and there on streaming services, but your best bet is this 32-track version on YouTube. The cassette was circulated by Jay himself in different iterations in the late ’90s, with different sequences and some different beats, and subsequently passed around the music industry via second- and third-generation dubs. It did not even have a name. Dilla-heads assigned it a title after the fact, taken from the spoken introduction: “Another batch from the one they call Jay Dee.”</p>\r\n<p> “Batches” were what Jay called his musical dispatches—the primary way he communicated musically from his Detroit basement to the outside world.  Another Batch is the crucial turning point, not only in Dilla’s evolution but in that of popular music itself, because Another Batch marks the true birth of “Dilla Time,” the rhythmic time-feel that became his ultimate signature and his most enduring legacy.</p>\r\n<p>I got my copy from Raphael Saadiq’s manager Ruth Carson sometime in 1999, while I was executive producing an album for the rap artist Chino XL. Carson was shopping beats on behalf of Jay Dee, whom many of us in the hip-hop business had come to revere for his tracks with De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Pharcyde, and Busta Rhymes, and I was amped to preview his latest material. But I had a bizarre physiological reaction to Another Batch—one especially surprising for hip-hop. I fell into a kind of woozy, meditative state. Beyond the hiss and flutter of the tape, there was something innately ethereal about the tracks themselves, something I couldn’t quite put my finger on yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time he began circulating Another Batch, Jay was already three years into a successful career. From the very beginning of that run, he had been messing around with timing in his beats, mostly by programming them into an E-mu SP-1200 drum machine freehand, without quantization, the function that snaps errant notes onto a rigid timing grid. He made many of his first songs in this way, on this machine, like the Pharcyde’s “Runnin’” and “Stakes Is High” by De La Soul. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But sometime in 1997—and this is really important—James switched machines. The Akai MPC, designed by the maestro of sampling and sequencing, Roger Linn, had a number of advanced rhythmic features. “Shift Timing” allowed users to nudge individual notes forward or backward in time, revolutionary for its time. It also had Linn’s groundbreaking “swing” function, one that the SP and other machines had copied, which could make the spaces in between notes uneven. But the MPC gave users more control: every sonic element could be swung at a different rate, rather than all the sounds at the same rate. Not even Linn realized the implications of his decision to allow this freedom. Perhaps that’s why no beatmaker in the 10 years between the MPC’s debut in 1988 and the release of Another Batch had employed these functions to displace sounds with severity, causing deliberate, ongoing micro-rhythmic conflict, until Jay Dee began using (or rather, misusing) them. The effect was the rhythmic equivalent of “The Princess and The Pea”—tiny shifts that had profound effects, continually tricking the inner ear. No wonder I was dizzy upon first listen.</p>\r\n<p>After hearing Another Batch, I flew to Detroit with Chino XL to meet Jay. We descended into his subterranean studio to find Common there, crafting the album that would become Like Water for Chocolate. Jay was quiet, and Chino and I tried to entertain him over dinner with stories of our years working with Rick Rubin, and how we got ourselves thrown out of Canada the previous night. It was a brief sojourn, and Chino ultimately walked away with two beats selected from the 60 tracks on our version of the tape, which became the songs “Don’t Say A Word” and “How It Goes” on his 2001 album, I Told You So. </p>\r\n<p>Diehard Dilla fans might recognize two of the other tracks on Another Batch as the beginnings of “Microphone Master” and “Don’t Nobody Care About Us” by Detroit MC Phat Kat. There’s one that became an interstitial at the end of the album version of Common’s 2000 hit “The Light,” as well as an early version of the song “E=MC2” that Common rocked on Dilla’s posthumous album, The Shining. There’s also a track that made it onto an advance of Voodoo that D’Angelo never quite finished in time for his album’s release in 2000. </p>\r\n<p>Much of the best stuff on Another Batch never saw the light of day. Take one track that fans online have labeled “The Wind,” and his friends sometimes call “Where is Jay?” owing to the wispy, inscrutable vocal sample that blows in and out of earshot. For the music bed, Dilla sampled several seconds of quiet piano from “Frevo” by the Brazilian jazz composer Egberto Gismonti. Then he slowed the sample down. As it became slower, it became murkier. Dilla added synth strings, which hold a high, hopeful note, contrasting the otherwise somber mood. And the rhythm track: Kick drum knocking, snare drum cracking, and a resonant, dancing bass line that essentially reharmonized the piano—taking a couple of chords buried within an existing composition and turning them into a new progression. Years later, jazz musicians like Robert Glasper would herald this skill of Dilla’s as an enviable kind of composition and improvisation. Most importantly, the drums on this track bore a new rhythmic subterfuge, courtesy of the MPC: Dilla had shifted the snare drum, in his parlance, a “baby hair” earlier than where one would expect it to fall. As a result, the whole track—as would so many others on *Another Batch—*acquired this disorienting, limping quality.</p>\r\n<p>Another Batch marks the consummation of the composer’s three timing techniques: decelerating samples to reveal human error, playing freehand to add randomness, and the crowning tactic, displacing sounds using the timing functions of the machine. And yet Dilla uses his formulas in ways that feel unformulaic: “The Wind,” its melancholy tempered by an optimistic harmonic lift at the end of each phrase. The buoyant “La La La,” based around a synth keyboard crescendo, with a bit of vocal accompaniment from the producer himself. A spirit-raising, eardrum-splitting beat sometimes called “Real Fine” or “Friend of Mine,” in which Dilla performs surgery on the 1980 record “Speak Your Mind” by Kevin Moore (aka Keb’ Mo’ before he was Keb’ Mo’). In Another Batch, beatitude lives inside tough, rhythmic exoskeletons; or maybe it’s the opposite, each beat a firmament inside a cloud.</p>\r\n<p>Dilla’s sound sources are plentiful and counterintuitive: Cal Tjader, Tangerine Dream, Phillip Glass, Joe Pass, Daryl Hall & John Oates. Given Dilla’s well-noted habits as a deep, patient listener, it’s conceivable that he listened to every moment of every song on Hall & Oates’ Rock \'n Soul Part 1, right up until the end of the very last one, a recording of their song “Wait for Me” performed live at the Montreal Forum in 1983. After four minutes, the song is basically over, and it’s just Darryl Hall ad-libbing chords on his electric piano, singing the words “It’s fair” over and over. But it is this moment that rivets Dilla’s attention. At precisely four minutes and 44 seconds, Hall plays a four-chord figure—moving from gloom into light, one-two-three-FOUR!—and lets that last chord ring out over the screams and cheers from the audience. In his sample, Dilla slices the end off of Hall’s incantation; it isn’t fair, after all. This becomes the harmonic and textural bed for a stuttering beat, made all the more robotic and angular by the hard reflections of the concert hall and the digital clipping of Hall’s vocal. </p>\r\n<p>The Roots called the untitled track “Hall & Oates” when they attempted to recreate its lopsided gait and inscrutable sonics on their 2010 mixtape, Dilla Joints. And Dilla Joints inspired a singer-songwriter named Jon Bellion to attempt his own live recreation of the beat on national television when he and his band appeared on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show in 2016. “Rest in peace, J Dilla,” Bellion said as he performed a Dilla beat with no name, from a collection with no name.</p>\r\n<p>J Dilla’s influence rings through the decades after his death. But the reason it does is largely because of this little beat tape. It’s this tape that makes its way to Electric Lady Studios, which—along with tracks Jay made concurrently for his group Slum Village—moves D’Angelo to renegotiate musical time with musicians like Questlove, Pino Palladino, Charlie Hunter, and Raphael Saadiq in making Voodoo. It’s this tape that spills over into Common’s Like Water for Chocolate. It’s this tape that makes its way to a studio in Philadelphia where acts like Jill Scott and Floetry and Musiq Soulchild were creating and extending neo-soul, Dilla’s rushed snare becoming their own rhythmic totem. </p>\r\n<p>The sounds, signatures, and techniques that actually made Dilla influential all coalesced on Another Batch: the deployment of soft, round timbres from Fender Rhodes keyboards and vibraphones; the use of common-tone to provide a sunny lifeline in all the melancholy; the samples of indecipherable, tense vocal harmonies; the extraction of obscure, perfect guitar and piano riffs from larger compositions; the bass lines reframing the chords; the swung high hats. And those cracking, microscopically misaligned snares, which would soon surface everywhere in popular music, where they remain even today, throwing us off balance.\r\n', 'images/j_dilla.jpg', '2023-02-09', '11:29:00', 'J Dilla', 4);

(21, 'Matthew Ismael Ruiz', 'Shook', 'With a crew of equally radical peers in tow, the Atlanta band’s new album is a dissonant but hopeful statement about dreaming up a better world.', '<span style=\"font-size:35px; font-weight: 600;\">A</span>lgiers’ politics are not subtle: For starters, they draw their name from a place once at the heart of the anti-colonial struggle. The Atlanta band’s lyrics are staunchly anti-capitalist, fueled by the righteous anger of people who know exactly how we got here and who’s to blame. Moreover, frontperson Franklin James Fisher is hyper-aware of his place as a Black frontman in a white industry—and of how the band’s values inform the way they’re perceived. While their debut was tight and focused, the group has sometimes buckled under the weight of their own bombast, hunched like Atlas as they carry a burden so great it threatens to crush them. But Shook, while characteristically dark and deadly serious, feels different. It’s a record built around community, evidence that when the struggle is shared with like-minded peers, it feels lighter. So does the music.</p>\r\n<p>The group draws from an eclectic palette (gospel, blues, rap, jazz, R&B, metal, spoken word), creating a chaotic patchwork underpinned by industrial drums and synths. As influences, they cite producers DJ Premier and DJ Screw; first-wave New York punks Dead Boys; East Berlin post-punks Dïat; Memphis MC Lukah; and the rappers of Buffalo, NY crew Griselda. It’s intentionally disparate, but you can see where the dots connect: The way Premier and Screw used wildly different ways to manipulate previously recorded material; both the New York and German bands’ sneering tone, which drips with sarcasm; and the outsider ethos of rappers spiritually connected to New York City, even if they’re physically distant from it. It’s difficult to pinpoint, but these ostensibly paradoxical legacies intertwine all throughout Shook.</p>\r\n<p>The characters that populate the album help narrow the scope of their rage, zooming in on individual perspectives and experiences. When the rapper-producer Backxwash raps, “The news said I was looney/Till poof, happens to you” on “Bite Back,” she does so in a world that seeks to criminalize her existence, in a verse that leans heavily on the infamous manhunt of former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner. When Rage Against the Machine’s Zack de la Rocha barks, “What it be, God?/No rehab for my jihad” on “Irreversible Damage,” he does so from the heart of his band’s radical ethos.</p>\r\n<p>Yet no figure has as much influence on the overarching message of the LP as Big Rube, the spoken word poet best known for his Dungeon Family affiliation and his narration on classic OutKast records. The rumbling bass tones of Rube’s voice, which are peppered throughout the album, instantly lend Shook a strong sense of place, declaring from jump that this record is a product of Atlanta. And there’s a gentleness to his speech, its weathered texture hinting at hardships endured. He serves as the record’s—and in some ways, the city’s—conscience, the wise old uncle willing to give you the unvarnished truth.</p>\r\n<p>The themes on Shook are often bleak. But wherever there is struggle, there is also joy. The skit “Comment #2” features the activist An Do, who speaks about how marginalized communities struggle to be seen outside of the context of their oppression. When your experience of pleasure is erased, and your identity reduced to your most tragic moments, your status as “other” is solidified. Still, there’s not much handholding here—listening to Shook, it can be difficult to find moments of levity amid the suffering and rage. Instead, its brief buoyancy is camouflaged: Consider the battered optimism of the instrumental breakdown on “Irreversible Damage” (“That’s what hope sounds like in 2022 when everything’s falling apart,” Fisher said in a statement upon the song’s release), or the “brown skin shining against the sun” in LaToya Kent’s poetic performance on “Born.”</p>\r\n<p>That said, the group sounds most natural at their darkest—the reverbed growl of guitars, the synths colored with dirt and grime. They benefit from Matt Tong’s virtuosic drumming, which feels looser and more alive than any drum machine. While much of their early work stuck closely to standard pop song structures, they seem less restricted by convention than ever, building on the sound collages found on their tour mixtapes and one-off projects, like “Can the Sub Bass Speak?” (a reference to the foundational Gayatri Spivak essay). The Mark Cisneros collaboration “Out of Style Tragedy,” which starts with Fisher’s spoken word over a Sun Ra refrain, layers sample after sample until it unravels into dissonant noise. The link to Shook World, the mixtape that collaborator King Vision Ultra crafted from the album’s stems, is clear. Though Shook World’s raw, freewheeling structure often veers into the chaotic, ironically, the individual pieces that comprise Shook come into focus once deconstructed from their final form. Fisher’s words never ring clearer than when they’re cutting through the cacophony.</p>\r\n<p>An Algiers record often requires some heavy lifting in order for the listener to fully engage. Usually, it’s easier to fit the pieces together if you’re familiar with the political references, or if you’ve already been living under colonialism’s yolk. But Shook feels more urgent, more arresting, with performances that draw you into their world. In part, it’s because the band has become a conduit for the community they’ve built, their work elevated by their own mutual admiration society. If we are indeed the company we keep, the Algiers coalition is strong, talented, and not about to go down quietly.\r\n', 'images/algiers_shook.jpg', '2023-03-03', '15:30:00', 'Algiers', 1),

He wrote about these creatures in prose that is defamiliarized, exhausting, wickedly funny. The Russian composer Ekaterina Shilonosova, who performs as Kate NV, shares a similar sensibility with the Austro-Hungarian writer: On her excellent fourth record, WOW, there is a suite of animals, and she is both rigorous and whimsical about them. </p>\r\n<p>On WOW, NV abandons the slightly more legible songs of 2020’s Room for the Moon, and the cohesiveness of 2018’s для FOR, opting instead for delightfully fractured inscrutability. WOW is dense and hyper-saturated with chintzy synths, field recordings, and heavily manipulated vocals. Call it maximalism; call it pop music for people who happen to enjoy both Karlheinz Stockhausen and Lisa Frank. It exists in a zone that NV has been working in for a while, one that involves fermenting and reimagining everything from Japanese city pop to the ECM New Series to corny ’80s chart-toppers. Opener “oni (they),” which features Japanese-language lyrics written by Foodman, feels like being inside a pinball machine: Each flicker of synth lights up brilliantly, bouncing erratically from point A to B.</p> \r\n<p>Each song is its own absurd room. Like previous records, WOW makes good use of Found Sound Nation’s Broken Orchestra sample pack, sourced from damaged instruments from Philadelphia’s public schools. On “confessions at the dinner table,” there are synths that sound like they’re giggling or yawning, field recordings of a door opening, the sound of clinking dishes. Violin and clarinet burst in at the midpoint. It is like a food fight, rendered in the aesthetics of Věra Chytilová’s Daisies, where two girls in flower crowns stomp around on a table drinking brandy and throwing cake at each other, fucking with everyone they meet. </p>\r\n<p>But NV’s music isn’t twee. Just because something is cute doesn’t mean it’s not rigorous, and her playfulness has a purpose: In upsetting expectations, it’s meant to keep you on your toes. Her songs are slanted, oblique. “razmishlenie (thinking)” builds in such a way that you’d think it would eventually depressurize, yet it does not; it stays at the same level of intensity for the song’s duration. There’s no payoff, but not in a way that is necessarily disappointing. Her music can be a workout; its self-containment can be almost alienating.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps that’s because there’s not necessarily a narrative. You couldn’t say that WOW is about anything. Instead, it’s defined by its aesthetic cohesion, a beautiful sense of formal seriousness that holds court over the record’s surrealistic menagerie.  \r\n', 'images/katenv_wow.jpg', '2023-03-11', '19:30:35', 'Kate NV', 1),

This situation accounts for its unusual, slightly disarming tone: It’s a head-over-heels-in-love album, full of invitations to come and do whimsical things, but it’s also prickly and insular. If the influence of house and techno led Cows on Hourglass Pond to feel extroverted, 7s is a vision of a world where the clubs are shuttered and the walls are closing in. It’s not Avey’s shortest album (that would be Down There, at 34:44), but it feels the smallest, in part because it has the fewest tracks (seven) and in part because it continually retreats towards its own center.</p>\r\n<p>Avey is blessed with an excellent scream. You will not hear it on 7s. His vocals are uncharacteristically reserved throughout, thinning to a whisper on the sickly-sounding “Cloud Stop Rest Start” and at the end of “Lips at Night.” At 43, his voice has grown huskier and deeper, and he’s developed a lisp that’s also audible on Time Skiffs. As is common in his work, his vocals squirm through effects that make them sound oily and slightly nauseous, but unlike on Cows and Eucalyptus, this has the effect of making them less comprehensible. Even on a focused listen, you’ll probably only understand about 50 percent of the words.</p>\r\n<p>This turns out to be a blessing. 7s does not benefit from reading the lyrics, which are crammed with grammatically bizarre turns of phrase (“Your corporeal tube doesn’t seek me out from the fishies/I relish a homemade cast”) and pseudo-deep platitudes that make “Stairway to Heaven” sound profound (“Too often we are our villains and our heroes/Save ourselves and then we dig ourselves a fresh tomb”). The psychedelic pop tradition is conducive to nonsense, from the sly non-sequiturs of the Beatles to the impossibly evocative scenes conjured by Van Dyke Parks and Robert Hunter. But there’s good nonsense and bad nonsense, and 7s unfortunately errs on the wrong side.</p>\r\n<p>The album’s strongest lyrics tend to be the simplest and most direct, especially on “The Musical,” a song about Avey’s two decades in the music biz.  “Is your audience the trees, or do you crave to be a professional?” he asks aspiring musicians. It’s an expression of hard-won road-warrior knowledge that still shines with gratitude and amazement. “I remember T&C and I’ll surely remember your hand in mine,” Avey sings to Madelyn on “Lips at Night.” Listeners are unlikely to understand what he’s saying in the first half of the line, let alone what it means, but as his voice crests in the second half, the brain fog parts, and the declaration of love shines through.</p>\r\n<p>7s works best seen as a whole, as a triumph of love and empathy over adversity. It’s hard to know who Avey Tare is singing about on “Invisible Darlings,” though some of the language echoes early-pandemic sentiment towards essential workers, but the sense of opening one’s heart to the world is unmistakable. “Lips at Night” plays like gibberish until all of a sudden Avey says something like “we kissed,” and then it becomes a love song. Like the B-movie horror films that Avey loves, it’s better if you don’t nitpick the script. And though 7s is a step down in scale and inspiration from Cows on Hourglass Pond, the triumph of Time Skiffs means it’s hardly a worrying sign for his career. It’s actually kind of exciting. I can’t wait to see if the next AnCo album sounds like 7s—and how far opposite from it Avey can get.\r\n', 'images/aveytare_7s.jpg', '2023-03-12', '11:54:23', 'Avey Tare', 1),
(24, 'Madison Bloom', 'For Post-Punks Model/Actriz, Confrontation Is an Opportunity for Intimacy ', 'The Brooklyn quartet want to make you weep with their hypersexed industrial cuts. ', '<span style=\" font-size: 35px; font-weight: 600;\">O</span>ne frigid Saturday afternoon in February, Cole Haden and Ruben Radlauer lead me through the halls of the American Museum of Natural History to an unsettling tableau. The mustachioed half of Brooklyn’s Model/Actriz, both self-professed science nerds, present a display case where a plastic boy mannequin sits, dressed in faded jeans, a tucked in button-up, and a Yankees cap. One pant leg is rolled up to reveal a lethal snake bite. Haden takes in the bizarre sight, and then fires off the first of many perfectly-timed barbs of the day. “He looks like he’s playing in Mac DeMarco’s band,” the singer says. “This is what they don’t show you at Coachella.”</p>\r\n<p>Winding through glass vitrines of lizards and amphibians, they stop before a hulking Komodo dragon. Radlauer, the band’s drummer, confesses that he used to be “a reptile kid.” As a boy in west Los Angeles, lizards were his go-to Halloween costumes for years. To simulate a blue-tongued skink, he stained his mouth with hard candy. When he couldn’t decide between a cobra and a rattler, he invented a hybrid. “A cobra-Radlauer?” Haden asks, his weighty voice dragging a little. </p>\r\n<p>They were weird kids, to be sure, nothing less than you’d expect based on Model/Actriz’s feral sound. Haden grew up in rural Delaware, in an especially cramped town where gossip seemed to be printed on every milk carton. “One time I invited my friend to go see Lady Gaga in concert, and some lady from her church found out and wrote a letter with like 40 reasons why she shouldn’t go,” he tells me. Gaga is Haden’s patron saint, and he invokes her by name on “Crossing Guard,” an early single from Model/Actriz’s exhilarating debut, Dogsbody.</p>\r\n<p>Dogsbody melds dance music with industrial and menacing post-punk, but it shares DNA with more filigreed forms; Haden plays an opera diva, a vaudeville clown, a silk-draped chanteuse. His lyrics are lush and sanguine, sung in heaving baritone. On the pummeling, hypersexed “Mosquito,” Haden trembles as a sweet feast spills from his lips: “Frothed milk, honey butter in my/Fortified cherry reduction/Over cakes, après-dîner.” Each morsel feels three-dimensional, swaddled in ruby velvet and served to you on a silver tray.</p>\r\n<p>Along with its smorgasbord of Dionysian imagery—food, flesh, fabric—the album is also filled with allusions to ancient Greece itself. Haden depicts carved stone columns and “verdigris-covered faces of the divine.” The titular “Crossing Guard” is in fact Charon, the mythological ferryman who led souls across the river Styx into Hades. When I ask Haden what intrigues him about Greek mythology, he swirls into an elaborate meditation on the act of remembering. He tends to speak either in loping philosophical paragraphs or curtly trimmed phrases. Eventually, he explains that Greek mythology offered a setting to explore his own memories with different characters. “I didn’t want it to be a diary,” he says of the album. “I wanted it to be like theater…like building the stage. I am aesthetically and emotionally drawn to the Greek ilk. I love the drama and the multi-generational vendettas and love stories and infidelities.</p>\r\n<p>Model/Actriz formed after Radlauer and guitarist Jack Wetmore witnessed a 19-year-old Haden performing “a Laurie Anderson-type electronic opera” in a Boston basement, as the singer once put it. They were in music school at the time. “Our secret is that we all went to Berklee, though it’s not really a secret,” Radlauer tells me, a spiky T-Rex skeleton arching over us. “There’s baggage that comes along with that. I felt very unstimulated there. It was a lot of ‘music for musicians’ and fusion and jazz, just things that felt like academia.” </p>\r\n<p>The original lineup—which featured a rotating cast of bassists—eventually disbanded, and the project wasn’t resuscitated until everyone moved to New York. They enlisted bassist Aaron Shapiro, a fellow Berklee alum, and began shaping new material. “When we reformed I think we all came into it wanting to express joy, sadness, sexuality, love with earnestness,” Radlauer says. “Cole felt more comfortable baring himself rather than hiding behind a veil of a character.” In 2020, Model/Actriz released “Suntan,” a stormy synth-pop cut that erupts into an industrial assault, heralding the arrival of the refocused group. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After scanning the shark exhibit, we arrive at a display of Colima Dogs, the short, squat clay statues placed in ancient Mesoamerican tombs. Radlauer reads from a text panel: “‘A small dog was thought to guide a person’s soul to its proper place.’” Haden jumps in: “‘Small fat dogs are especially engaging…’” </p>\r\n<p>He bends his head slightly right and observes an egg-shaped protrusion under the dog’s tail. “The treatment of the anus,” he muses. “It’s distended.” We ponder the function of its shape for a moment, before Haden shifts into another gear. He’s thinking about Lady Gaga again. </p>\r\n<p>“Part of what really allured me at the time of Bad Romance was that it felt really illegal to like her,” Haden says. Was it too revealing an interest for a teenage boy in the sticks? “Yeah, I was not super keen on the idea of my sexuality at that point,” he says. “It took a lot of mental hurdles for me to be able to enjoy Lady Gaga the way I did while maintaining a grip on the reality that I wanted, which is that I wasn’t gay.” </p>\r\n<p>I ask Haden if he still seeks out art that feels dangerous. He nods. “When I recognize something that feels like more of a challenge, that feels gratifying to engage with. Like when Lady Gaga was doing Born This Way and The Fame Monster, she started talking about Marina Abramović. I could talk about Lady Gaga because that was a cultural figure that everybody knew, but if I tried to explain [Abramović] to my parents it would feel like a cult. Like showing them a picture of her in a burning star on the ground or showing her doing the knife challenge and cutting herself—that was what I would delete my history on my computer about.”</p>\r\n<p>Radlauer mentions an Instagram account he stumbled upon that posts photos of rotting animal carcasses. “I was immediately like, ‘no no no,’” he says. “But then, I don’t know why, I got into a zone scrolling through it and appreciating it as a tribute to the decay, and the appreciation of that life cycle.” Haden welcomes the parallel. “If you’re repulsed by something, it’s an opportunity to ask why,” he says. It could easily be the Model/Actriz doctrine.</p>\r\n<p>A little while later, the full band assembles at Joanne Trattoria, an Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side owned by Cynthia and Joseph Germanotta—aka Lady Gaga’s parents. Surrounded by framed family photos, Model/Actriz tuck into hearty plates of seafood pappardelle and sausage linguini while discussing fate, performance, and vulnerability. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Pitchfork: Do you think about creating a level of discomfort in your music?</span></p>\r\n<p>Cole Haden: Yeah. I think this album is the culmination of a lot of pain for me. When my mother would tell me, “everything happens for a reason,” the reason was never apparent to me. When the album was done, it felt like it was made at the right time because I understood my first 25 years of living were leading to this point.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Do you believe everything happens for a reason?</span></p>\r\n<p>Haden: Yeah, I’m a mystic. I read a story once, the point of it being like, “I’m living through my eyes right now, but I’ve lived through your eyes at some point.” Because as a physics nerd, time isn’t real. So that is what gives me the patience that I need in a daily sense. Like, I’m not the Dalai Lama every day, but when I’m lying in bed at night, that is my om with the universe.</p>\r\n<p>Ruben Radlauer: I like to take a mystical view of the opposite. I don’t think anything happens for any reason but I think there’s beauty to be observed in that. I take comfort in nothing mattering and having to imbue life with your own meaning and find something that makes it matter. I don’t think it’s sad that nothing matters. I don’t feel like a nihilist.</p>\r\n<p>Haden: I’m a grouchy optimist. I’m that song, “I’m a bitch/I’m a lover/I’m a child/I’m a mother.”</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">In the song “Amaranth,” why choose an existing plant to portray an imaginary, magical flower that never fades?</span></p>\r\n<p>Haden: I came upon the word “amaranth” by way of Enya’s 2005 song “Amarantine.” I used to drive to high school blasting The Very Best of Enya in my car. Parking in the student lot while the chorus from “Anywhere Is” played felt like a serve. “Amaranth” did somehow become the most similar to an Enya song, lyrically at least, in the sense that the song is set in a strange yet familiar wilderness.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">J.M.W. Turner’s Rain, Steam, and Speed - The Great Western Railway is invoked in a similar way to Lady Gaga on “Crossing Guard.” What intrigues you about that painting?</span></p>\r\n<p>Haden: The J.M.W. Turner painting, like Lady Gaga, is something that through its boldness helps me give permission to myself to trust my instincts. It was made in 1844 and I think the way its textures and mood—which would later become more popular with Impressionism—feel more like a risky artistic decision in that painting. When I’m trying to find my own voice, I look to people who have found theirs as a way to boost my confidence in doing the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Can you talk about some of the objects and textures that inspired the composing process for Dogsbody? A train passing, a trash can, a car revving, etc.</span></p>\r\n<p>Radlauer: The car rev was an accident.</p>\r\n<p>Haden: That was just a blissful moment of someone revving their engine while I was doing a vocal take. It was a reverb chamber with a microphone placed in it, right next to the road. So it was the most beautiful synchronicity that was unintentional. But that’s just being God’s favorite.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">But do you also try to mimic certain nonmusical sounds with your instruments?</span></p>\r\n<p>Jack Wetmore: Yeah. It’s been a huge part of the instrumental thing for a long time. One of the first songs we did was “Heavy Breather,” which is just trying to sound like a train.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Many articles have described your shows as “confrontational.” Do you feel like that’s accurate?</span></p>\r\n<p>Haden: It’s just because I’m getting close to people. It’s not singling people out. I think I see it more like I’m giving them a private moment of a show only they’re seeing.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Shapiro: Cole’s really good at reading body language and knows a person who wants to be within their own space and doesn’t want to have that moment. And to them it is confrontational. I think it’s cool that someone can be like, “The idea of Cole coming up to me caused so much chaos in my brain, that made the show feel aggressive.” But the reality is that Cole probably is not going up to those people. For the people who Cole is sharing those moments with, I don’t think those are the words they would use to describe it. I feel like it would be a lot more like, “tenderness.”</p>\r\n<p>Haden: Or often, “crying.”</p>\r\n<p><span style=\" font-weight: 600;\">Like a Marina Abramović moment?</span></p>\r\n<p>Haden: Yeah. I mean, there are memes about The Artist Is Present, but I’m just envious of that performance. I’m choking up about it right now, but it’s just so rare that you can share that with somebody. Performing is such a gift, and a bodily experience for me. It’s the one time that there’s nowhere I can escape because I have to be there. I can’t distract myself. I have to be there in my body. And it’s always astonishing to me, the beauty you are able to conjure in that space with another person.\r\n', 'images/model_actriz.jpg', '2023-03-17', '23:49:31', 'Model/Actriz', 3);
